    "html": "What are they?<p>Phishing is defined as: the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.</p><p>In the past, we’ve mentioned phishing attacks and included them in our scam and spam reports. But these attacks have mostly been carried out over email. Nowadays, scammers are using every type of communication they can to take people’s money. This has given rise to two new terms:</p><p>which refers to SMS phishing.</p><p>Andwhich refers to voice phishing.</p>How do they work?<p>Although ‘smishing’ and ‘vishing’ are new words, it’s important to remember that they operate in the same way as phishing – these scammers are all trying to get money or personal information. So whether it’s an SMS or call or email, it’s important to look for common red flags that reveal it could be fake.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NjA1YjAxMTUtNTEwNS00NzE4LTgwYjAtYTk5YjMyNjY0MmYy_uyzmm3ytzlmthh_tsyyrprwaneya3_-e_3nd_whzxekyxz783es8l-lafsz1a21aarplhm5axuaah2dtpbpwii-fxuctnkcuas8hykfr_-m7to8yjdxmw8fft3kuv6b_kgtirbhdqmukmy29e6f5oip?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><p>Smishing – </p><p>A typical smishing scam will message you telling you that you have won a prize, that you owe the tax office (or the tax office owes you), or that you have an unpaid bank fee. We’ve seen many other variations of this, but a common red flag is a link in the message. So it’s important to be wary of links in messages such as these.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is that organisations like banks or even government agencies would rarely ask for personal information over a text message. Go through official websites when communicating to these organisations.</p><p></p><p>Read more about Smishing Scams here. </p><p>Vishing – </p><p>A vishing scam starts with a phone call. A typical call will inform you of a compromised bank account, an investment offer, an IT issue or a charity drive. They will sometimes use a text-to-speech voice or automated recording.</p><p>Vishing scams often use number spoofing to appear as a legitimate source. However, Vishing is much more of a problem for those who don’t have a Caller ID app such as Truecaller.</p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><p>What can I do to prevent Smishing and Vishing attacks?</p><p>Scammers are getting more sophisticated at pretending to be someone they’re not. So identifying that it’s a scam as soon as possible is very important.</p><p>If you’re asking yourself, ‘why does this person sound so urgent?’ Or ‘why is this person asking me to confirm all my personal information?’ – You might be onto a scam.</p><p>The best advice we can give is to be very careful when sending personal information. If, for example, you receive a message that you must pay a fee to your bank, and are unsure, go to the bank’s official webpage and login. Or you can call the bank from the number that is listed from their official webpage. Always try and go through their official channels – this advice can be applied to almost all the scams that we have been made aware of.</p><p>Also, update your Truecaller app! With a community of over 300 million people verifying numbers, Truecaller offers the best protection.</p><p>———————————–</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Instagram India, Instagram India, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and Twitter India.

    "html": "<h2>\nAccess to crucial Helplines</h2><p>Covid Helpline\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country saw a dire need to connect with reliable sources of help and information. While the need for medicines and medical attention increased amongst the people, scammers tried to take advantage of this situation. \nTo reduce the threat of falling into such diabolical scams, Truecaller integrated a Covid Healthcare Directory which brought together Covid-related points of interest, including all vaccination centres across the country, Covid designated hospitals, test centres and so on. Even today, you’ll find the national Covid Helpline pinned on the Quick Dial feature on the Truecaller app to enable prompt communication with the right authorities and medical experts if required. \n\n181 Women’s Helpline\nOver the years, Truecaller has worked to raise awareness and incite action against the harassment of women, both online and offline. This year, we took this fight to the next level by inspiring women to call out harassment through our #ItsNotOK initiative. As a part of the initiative, we teamed up with the Delhi Commission for Women, the Delhi Police, and other integral authorities to strengthen this message of calling out harassment. The 181 National Women Helpline was added to Truecaller's homepage, which led to more women being aware of the availability of this helpline. Post the integration in March 2022, the average of 2000 calls per day, grew to more than 4,000 calls per day resulting in over a 100% increase in total calls received per day. \n\n112 Emergency Helpline\nMany people aren’t aware of all the emergency helpline numbers when they encounter an emergency. The Central Government of India has launched the number 112 as a single emergency number, which one can access to get in touch with all the other existing helplines, like the Police, Fire and Women Helpline numbers. </p><p>The new emergency helpline number, 112, appears in a prominent position in the Quick Dial feature on the homepage of the Truecaller app, to help anyone contact the police and the right authorities in times of distress or emergency.\n\n</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NmFkNDk2MzgtYWQ5My00NTE4LWJiNjMtNzU4ZjY0OGUwYjUw_a0c1267f-8b31-4926-8b7b-50ee1c140f02_helplinenum.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><p>Celebrating India on the app\nCompleting 75 years of Independence is a massive milestone for India, and we wanted to cherish the moment by integrating the tricolours into the app to celebrate the love and patriotism towards our second home country. Taking this forward, we have partnered with the Ministry of Culture to play an integral role and extend the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav initiative to our 235 million users. Celebrating this incredible milestone with our Truecaller community, we have integrated the tricolour logo on the app, and highlighted the 75 years of Independence on the search bar to encourage you to get into the spirit of the #HarGharTiranga initiative by leading them to the government’s official website. </p><p>We are proud to continue building features tailored to and serve Indian citizens, to ensure that they stay free from spam, scam, and potential fraud in the world of communication. We are delighted to celebrate this occasion together on the app and with our real-world work.</p><p></p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZTU5NTRmYWYtZjRmZi00YmI1LTk1ZTUtYTg1NjkxNGU2ZjNk_ca543ba3-a577-47c7-82dc-bde65e2a033b_appchanges.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><p>Mural at the Civil Lines Police Station\nOver the past few months, the #ItsNotOk initiative in India has made a giant leap in creating awareness about resources available to report harassment and encouraging women to take a step further. In July 2022, we immortalised the #ItsNotOk initiative by unveiling a mural on the #CallItOutWall at the iconic wall of the Civil Lines Police Station, Delhi in partnership with the Delhi Police. Since women's safety is a crucial agenda in the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations, we added the logo as part of the design that highlights an ensemble of portraits of survivors who have called it out, the emergency helpline number along with representatives from law enforcement signifying their support towards women in their fight against harassment and their safety. The artwork has created significant citizen engagement by women sharing inspiring stories and encouraging others to take action by directing them to the right resources. \n</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YjY5OWY5YjktYTQ5Yi00ZTlmLThlZTMtOTE5ZGFiNzdmNDJj_a21bb915-96db-465d-a4c6-c90500e693ca_mural.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><p>One doesn’t need to fight a war to enjoy any form of freedom. It can also come in the form of peaceful initiatives, constant support from fellow citizens, and in our case - some features on the Truecaller App. So when it’s about enjoying privacy as well as freedom in the world of communication, the Truecaller app and community will always have your back.

    "html": "<p>Her journey at Truecaller started in 2012. Before that, Lindsey was living and working in the Greek Islands, where she met her husband. Looking for a new adventure, they moved to Sweden without knowing anyone.</p><p>Back then, Truecaller was only a handful of people. The marketing \"team\" was just Lindsey and one other person. It was a very startup-y vibe, even though Truecaller had 6 million users (which has skyrocketed to over 320 million as of 2022). This means she wore all the hats of a full team: a community manager, an actor, copywriter, scripter, photographer, videographer, editor, the voice of the social brand, an analyst and strategist. </p><p>She describes her work as addicting and limitless. Let's dive in and discover what life is like as a Director of Brand Marketing at Truecaller.</p><h2>Describe a typical day at work as a Director of Brand Marketing</h2><p>Brand building is more than a logo and a look. Brand is the entirety of how someone experiences your company. The job is about being creative, proactive, detail oriented, and seeing the bigger picture from a strategic level. I juggle many different moving parts of the brand - from determining how we speak with our users, which stories we tell in our campaigns, how we are perceived, creative strategies to grow our user base and social share of voice, and even employer branding.</p><p>Throughout the day, I am speaking with anyone from development to creative, our co-founders, support, to also agencies in our main and growth markets to plan and execute our product or brand marketing campaigns. We do most of our global campaign work in-house, which is what my team focuses on. </p><p>I tend to be very hands-on. I believe great leaders also create with their team - so I’ll block out time in the day to do some filming, editing videos, writing blogs, brainstorming, inspiring/cheerleading, and assisting my team wherever is needed. \n\nI always have my ‘social media’ command center live to see what our users are saying about us in real-time, and some might recognize my work as also being the admin responding to memes, questions, and fun moments on our social media accounts.  So please @ me (@Truecaller)</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZmFhYzhlNTAtOTg3Yi00ODQ3LTg4NDItMzg0N2MzOTQ1NTlh_2bbd0dd4-d4d0-477c-a146-a4c21bc25bea_screenshot2022-08-15at15.53.52.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2350,1260&w=2350&h=1260\" alt=\"Life as a Director of Brand Marketing at Truecaller\" width=\"2350\" height=\"1260\" /><h2>What do you enjoy the most about your job?</h2><p>They say 1 year working in Truecaller is like 3 years at any other tech company. Every day is different and sometimes unpredictable. I thrive off of finding solutions, trying new things, and diving into my creative heart. I love the cross-collaboration with the development teams, and also learning and working with different markets to come up with how to make Truecaller a household name. I also find speaking to our users and seeing the reactions from our campaigns extremely addicting and rewarding. We have incredibly clever Truecaller users that speak to us on our social media - and I love to have fun with that by conversing with them as the brand.</p><h2>What do you miss the most about the U.S.? And what do you like the most about Sweden?</h2><p>Everything I miss about the U.S. is not work related. I miss family and friends, but also how easily accessible everything is on a consumer level. In Sweden, I have to work a lot harder to find specific items or services because it is a small country - but in the end, that makes me more resourceful!  What I love about Sweden is the work-life balance, and how society values nature, wellness, and family. I have the opportunities to do so much more with my free time due to this.</p><h2>What do you think is the best part about being part of multicultural teams? </h2><p>Our different backgrounds in where we grew up bring a new dynamic to everything we do. Especially when it comes to new market development - it is essential we think globally to analyze our brand perception and make snap decisions on bringing the brand and Truecaller product to life. We do a lot of storytelling of how Truecaller has changed the  world of communication, and for that we need understanding of different languages, religions, and cultural norms to put all the puzzle pieces together. </p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MjhhZDU0YWEtODE5NC00YzY1LWFhNDItMmE4NmU0NGQ5NTMw_d7ffbe27-b5ad-4073-ab13-c54cbdc3397b_big_dsc505628229.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,6016,4016&w=6016&h=4016\" alt=\"Life as a Director of Brand Marketing at Truecaller\" width=\"6016\" height=\"4016\" /><h2>What is the biggest challenge you faced as a Director of Brand Marketing? </h2><p>Brand building itself is the challenge of any brand marketer’s career. In different departments, teams often work in agile form with 2-week to 7-week sprints to accomplish a task. With brand building, however, a simple task could take months or years to see results. This would include activities such as brand perception, campaign recognition, community building, and product recall. Exceptional ideas and execution that break free from the ‘noise’ of other brands is imperative to bring a brand vision to life. The ideas themselves are more important than a big budget. You need to have the tools and resources to recognize brilliance and act quickly.</p><h2>How do you feel the digital transformations have impacted the tech industry? </h2><p>Every brand more or less has an app. This means that the talent needed to create those apps has changed over the years. Instead of engineers working on hardware in a factory, we now have software engineers that can work digitally from anywhere in the world. Also, the digital transformation has completely changed how we market. No longer are we looking at traditional marketing strategies like snail mail, newspaper ads, surveys or cold calls (which, as we know at Truecaller, are not really appreciated!). Marketers are coordinating with influencers and creating two-way communication with their customers on social platforms. I find it incredibly interesting seeing how the digital world has evolved in the past 15 years.</p><h2>What is the best career lesson you’ve learned so far?</h2><p>Your title is never too big for small details in your work. Throughout someone’s career, we grow in our positions and hopefully will seek a challenging career path. While I have had the wonderful opportunity to start as an entry level community manager at Truecaller back in 2012 to now leading the creative brand team, those early skills of being a ‘jack of all trades’ is what layed my foundation to know how to navigate what works well with Truecaller’s brand. And I find it fun to join in the fun to create!</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/N2UyZTZiZjItNzEyYS00YWM5LWE3ODEtZDBhZGZjZGU5NDFj_1249b706-d732-4cbf-87b0-d3fec916cf11_summer-party2832of929282291.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1836,1225&w=1836&h=1225\" alt=\"Life as a Director of Brand Marketing at Truecaller\" width=\"1836\" height=\"1225\" /><h2>What would you describe as the main benefit of working at Truecaller?</h2><p>I love the flat hierarchy style Truecaller has - if someone has an idea or a side project, we are encouraged to explore and potentially, it could end up in the app or being a staple campaign. Another aspect I have newly experienced is the amazing benefit of parental leave, which I returned from 1 year off. I think it’s especially important for women in tech to feel comfortable and confident in their decision to take time off to focus on raising their children while building their career.</p><h2>You were just on maternity leave, what has changed at Truecaller?</h2><p>Truecaller has grown a lot in that time, especially in new markets and new teammates. I look forward to expanding the brand value proposition, diving back into creating with my team, and harnessing the power of what Truecaller can do in new markets.</p><p>You can find more stories behind the code on our blog.

I decided to move from my home city in Spain to Sweden in the middle of a pandemic in 2020, looking for new opportunities and experiences. </p><p>But what nobody tells you about adventures is that sometimes the beginning is never quite what you imagine it to be.</p><p>When I was looking for a job, I received so many “no’s” that I couldn’t count them. The imposter syndrome knocked on my door, whispering: you are not good enough. </p><p>But nothing lasts forever if you are resilient, and the opportunity to start an internship at Truecaller as a content creator appeared at my doorstep.</p><h2>Starting my adventure at Truecaller</h2><p>I remember my first day as if it were yesterday. I was nervous and excited at the same time. Meeting new people is something miles away from my comfort zone. I entered through the door and met Despi, the first smiley face you’ll see at the Truecaller Stockholm office. After that, everything happened very fast, and I started to feel at home.</p><p>It’s true that time really flies when you are having fun. One year has passed since I opened the door to Truecaller’s office for the first time. </p><h2>My experience at Truecaller</h2><p>Now I work as a content creator focused on employer branding in the Brand and Marketing team in Stockholm. One of the most rewarding aspects of my job is collaborating with people from different backgrounds and nationalities. Talking with them during my daily tasks helps me explore new angles for solving problems and growing, not only professionally but personally.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YjE3NjNhMTMtOWFlMy00ODZiLTg2OTctYmIyNWZhYjkyNzRl_624772e3-777c-4f23-8794-c6682cb2c4b6_team.gif?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,659&w=1200&h=659\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"659\" /><p>If you ask me why I like working at Truecaller, I would not be able to pick just one thing because every day is a new adventure. Each project presents unique challenges, so no day is like any other. I enjoy coming in every day and seeing the never-ending amount of fun things that happen every day. Truecaller has a light-hearted atmosphere and a collaborative culture essential to feeling motivated and inspired at work.</p><p>I truly believe that teamwork makes the dream work. I learn from my colleagues, and I’m so happy to see how we’re growing as a team. We support each other and work together to bring our ideas to life. </p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MDY2YTM1OTYtNjI4My00YzdhLWFjMjItYWI4NDMxZTAyNGUy_7cf5aa38-2124-428c-9bb6-2c747b997657_team328129.gif?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,578,433&w=578&h=433\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"433\" /><h2>What about the future?</h2><p>I am very excited to see what the future has prepared for me. At Truecaller, I have the opportunity to upscale my skills and pursue my professional development.

    "html": "<h2>What is Truecaller SDK</h2><p>Truecaller SDK offers a mobile number verification service so that you can onboard your users without the need for a one time password (OTP), or the hassle of email based signup. It’s a simple, instant and secure verification process. By using Truecaller SDK in a mobile app or a mobile website, this seamless verification drives user growth and retention.</p><h2>The story of BigBasket</h2><p>BigBasket was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Bangalore. They work with local farmers to make sure they always have fresh, high quality produce for customers to be delivered to their doorstep. BigBasket believes in being smart, quick, and efficient, making life as leisurely as possible. With the help of tech they keep their inventories digitised, not only for cost efficiency, but also to make sure they minimise wastage. </p><h2>How growth made BigBasket turn to Truecaller</h2><p>Back in 2019, BigBasket started to focus on growth and one thing they were looking to improve was customer experience. Chief among this, the onboarding experience for customers. They had been using OTPs and more complex solutions, making it a slow and costly procedure. The solution was implementing the features of Truecaller SDK. Truecaller SDK is free to use and can be implemented by businesses to verify registered as well as non-registered Truecaller users, offering a seamless onboarding experience.</p><h2>How Truecaller made an impact</h2><p>After implementing Truecaller SDK, BigBasket saw an increase of 5% in customer conversions, making sure that both new and existing customers could easily place their order and have their food or household goods delivered to their doorstep.</p><h2>This is how the verification process works</h2><p>For users who have the Truecaller app present on their smartphones and are already registered Truecaller users, verification is a 1-tap flow, without the need for any manual input. For users who don’t have the Truecaller app present on their smartphones, the SDK enables user verification by means of a ‘drop call’, which is triggered to the user’s number in background to complete the verification flow (currently supported only for India). </p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>What to think about when implementing Truecaller SDK</h2><p>Even though Truecaller SDK is an easy way to onboard your customers, you should also have a look at your entire onboarding process, making sure that you achieve the results you are looking for. There is not a one size fits all kind of solution, but more of a way of looking at it from the outside in. We have gathered some best practices on designing the right user flow in order to make it easier for you to onboard your users via Truecaller SDK.</p><p>If you are interested in improving your signup process, reach out to our SDK team. If you are looking for a way for new and existing customers to pick up more of your calls, we recommend Truecaller for Business. </p><p>Also, update your Truecaller app! With a community of over 300 million people using Truecaller every month, Truecaller offers a great communication experience.</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Instagram India, Facebook, TikTok, TikTok Indonesia, Twitter, and Twitter India.

    "html": "<h2>The Dilemma of Smart SMS</h2><p>Currently SMS threads or conversations are categorised only by the spam reports available against a sender in most of the countries globally. So if a sender has a lot of spam reports, all messages from that sender will land in the spam folder. That gives us some challenges. For example: what if you love going to the movies, so when you’re getting promotional texts from the movie theatre close by, you get excited and make plans to go the same night. Your neighbour really hates going to the movies, and marks the same message as Spam faster than you can say “Action”.</p><p>There’s your dilemma. It could also be that the same sender sends both informational/transactional messages, and messages that could be categorised as Promotional/Spam messages. It’s all about the content.</p><h2>The Solution to Improving Smart SMS is Content Based Filtering</h2><p>Content based filtering helps solve this dilemma. Our machine learning models look at the content of your message offline, (within your device itself) to figure out whether the message is useful or not. The message content never actually leaves your device, but with the help of the machine learning model is categorised as spam or important. While this happens, this machine model can also be updated based on your preferences. You (yes you, VIP) are able to give feedback directly against the message so the machine learning model within your device learns that certain messages from a sender are spammy in nature while certain other messages are important and puts them in the right inbox. This brings you real value right out of the box because the system is much more nuanced and you will only be notified about messages that are relevant to you.</p><p>This system also learns and grows automatically with time. You have the ability to mark a message as important or spam right from the conversation. We hope you know how you can help others by only reporting a number as spam, right in the Truecaller app.\nYour feedback does two things to make Smart SMS truly SMART: </p><li>It tweaks the model offline (on your device itself) so that future messages which are similar to the message marked by you, fall into the appropriate inbox. So, no more notifications from spammy messages!</li><li>Also, with your permission, we send the masked message to our backend to automatically improve the categorisation model globally, so that millions of users around the world benefit from the feedback that you’ve provided.. When we say masked message we mean that after you grant permission, we remove all the personal and sensitive information from the message and only then we send the message to our backend. So your actual, complete message is still available on your device, offline. </li><p>One cool aspect of this two pronged approach is that , even if the whole world says that a specific message is important to them, but you have marked said message as spam, the model learns from your feedback  and tries to mark the message in question as spam itself.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YzE5ZTZhMGEtYjQyYi00OWRkLThmYzYtNDBjMGMzN2VhNjRl_1e0acaca-0505-4ae6-80a8-fd97476a7d70_smartsms-articlecreative.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1350&w=2400&h=1350\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" /><h2>Country or Regional Specific Content</h2><p>Messages and senders vary around the world, and we have taken that into consideration. This also means that the content based filtering will improve over time, as more and more people start using the feature. The more people in a region using Truecaller equals a faster learning system.</p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>Help Me To Help Myself</h2><p>Or rather – help yourself, and the rest will be helped as well. That would be a great slogan for this feedback we’re asking of you. The more you tell us about what kind of messages you’re getting, the better we can make sure you’re only getting what you want. And at the same time, this will help others as well. Or even better – you will be helped by a community of over 300 million people, doing exactly the same thing as you are. While using Truecaller as your default SMS app, you can rest assured that you will never miss out on an important SMS and stay protected from spam because of the sheer volume of community feedback from over 300 million people.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Let’s make Smart SMS even smarter, together.</p><p>Also, be sure to keep your Truecaller app updated! </p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.</p><p>If you’re based in India: Instagram India, and Twitter India.</p><p>Based in Indonesia: Instagram Indonesia, TikTok Indonesia. </p><p>Yes, we are available to you everywhere!</p>"

A gastronomical consultant, and host of the youtube channel ‘Alltid Hungrig’ (Always Hungry), Mikael sat down for an interview recently in Stockholm.</p><p>‘In my line of work as a gastronomical consultant I help companies that work with food to develop concepts. I do a lot of food photography, I develop recipes for restaurants or for companies that work with media’</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NTdmMjk2OGItYzYxYi00MTQ0LTgxOTMtM2FjNDgyYTNiYjBj_mgvmnddinwutmdbmms00m2vjlwfhyzktytk0ytiwnmzhndgw_micke-kok-.jpgresize7002c394ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,394&w=700&h=394\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /><h2>Communication in Sweden</h2><p>Communication in Sweden is a little different from other countries. Contact details and personal information is widely available on websites like hitta.se, as part of the country’s culture of transparency and openness. Swedish people can register not to be on these databases. But for people who run a business, that’s not an option.</p><p>‘In Sweden you can actually block your number at something called the ‘Nix register’ but as a small business owner I don’t have the privilege. So basically anyone can call me if you want to sell me something, so that’s why it’s so good to have the app so i can screen the calls’</p><h2>Getting Annoying Calls</h2><p>Mikael receives many annoying calls because of his business.</p><p>‘As a self-employed with a youtube channel, I get a lot of calls from other salespersons or people that I don’t want to connect with. So I use the phone a lot and I use the app a lot. It’s a good way to see incoming calls from people I want to talk to and incoming calls from people I don’t want to talk to. So I can basically choose.’</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/Y2VkOTY0ZGEtMDFjOC00MmQ4LThlM2ItZmIyMDM0ZjY3OWYx_1cff1e7d-fa43-4453-b0f4-8c4bd3572a2e_52.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2048,1152&w=2048&h=1152\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" /><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><p>From early on, Mikael realised the community aspect of Truecaller, whereby it was the users that were all reporting the bad numbers, and helping everyone else avoid spammers.</p><p>‘What I like about the app is that it’s based on the community and to help each other. So when I block a call as spam, hopefully I help other people that are using it as well to avoid people that I don’t want to take my time to avoid. So it’s a community thing that we users help each other to avoid getting shitty calls’</p><h2>Avoiding Spam</h2><p>“As a small business owner I think there’s a lot of people that want to take advantage of me. It’s really nice to have the the scam caller function in this in the app so I can really see what calls are trying to reach me. And I can block them or I can screen them. It’s a good way for me to to use my time and then save my time avoiding talking to people that i want to talk to“.\n</p><p>As a user for over a decade, we’ll give Mikael the last word on Truecaller:\n‘At the end of the day, the best thing about the app is that you can forget about it. Because you know that it’s working for you and you don’t have to work with the app to get the results you want from it. It’s just a safe app to have in your phone’</p><p>For more True Stories, visit our Instagram</p>"

We’ve reported on scams related to vital COVID-19 supplies, scams taking money from charitable causes, and scams that focus on senior citizens. There is truly no depth to how low they will go. </p><h3>What is the scam?</h3><p>\nScammers are using fake websites and social media pages that offer baby formula. Parents then purchase the formula, but it never arrives. The scammers never intended to sell formula, they don’t even have baby formula.</p><h3>How do I know if it’s a scam?</h3><p>\nWe’ve said this before but we’ll say it again: only scammers ask for payment via gift cards. This is because they’re quick, easy to redeem and the scammers don’t need to leave information that will tie the crime to them.</p><p></p><p>Search Engines are also a good tool.

If a deal seems too good to be true, or if it’s difficult to verify who you’re buying from, then exercise caution. If you can’t find baby formula in retail stores or need to buy online, try and stick to buying from websites that you can trust.\n</p><p>Does the website look legitimate or does something seem a bit off? Is the URL from the website different than what you would expect from an online retailer? Are there lots of spelling mistakes on the website? If you’re asking yourself these questions then it might be a good idea to try somewhere else.\n</p><p>Ask your local paediatrician if they have access to formula or know healthcare providers/assistance programs that can help. \n</p><p>Baby formula is a crucial household item for many families. This, combined with shortages in many places, is the reason why it is attracting scammers. They are banking on many people overlooking certain details when purchasing because they desperately need it, so stay vigilant!</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.</p>"

The announcement brought a mad rush of people, including scammers.</p><h3>The Scams</h3><p></p><p>From what we’ve seen, these scams usually unfold in these ways:</p><p>A common type of student loan scam is a twist on the common ‘impersonation scam’. Impersonation scams are where scammers pretend to be part of a trustworthy organization, often using this to get personal details from the victim. There have been many reports of scammers pretending to be part of, or working on behalf of the Department of Education. Be wary of this.</p><p></p><p>Another type of Student Loan scam is where people accept payment for helping people apply for student loan forgiveness. Various companies have sprung up, some legitimate, and some not, that offer to help with the process of debt relief programs.</p><p></p><p>One thing that scammers target is your FSA ID login. It’s a personal detail that scammers are targeting. With it, they can make changes to your account without your consent. From what we’ve seen, it is best to avoid giving this away, unless it is directly with your loan provider, the Department of Education, or you are sure that the person you are dealing with can be trusted. </p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NGNjNTE5MWQtYzhjMi00ZjNlLWFiNTAtMjMwMjhhZWY3N2Q0_3ec23f9e-6713-4238-bd44-2e12790eef46_university-students-using-laptops-and-digital-scams_truecaller.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2320,1305&w=2320&h=1305\" alt=\"\" width=\"2320\" height=\"1305\" /><p>What to Do about Student Loan Scams</p><p></p><p>Keep your personal information just that: personal. Your FSA ID can be used by scammers and fraudsters. </p><p></p><p>Don’t let anyone help you apply for the student loan forgiveness program, they could be a scammer. Yes, there are private companies that can help you with that, but it is wise to make sure that they are officially partners with the Department of Education. If their credentials or website seem suspicious, avoid them entirely. In this case, it is best to go first to your loan servicer, the Department of Education or Student Aid (insert link to another blog). </p><p></p><p>Download Truecaller for your cell phone – this is a free call blocking app that also has intelligent spam and scam protection to detect fake IRS calls, robocalls, telemarketers and other types of unwanted numbers.

However, as with Smishing and Vishing, fraudsters have found new technologies like QR codes to lure and trick people with. </p><p>As with all types of Phishing attacks, the best way to avoid a QR code scam is to be very careful when sending personal information. Before entering your personal information or credit card / banking details, double check and triple check the website you’re on and be on the lookout for anything suspicious. </p><p>If the QR code is in a public place, check to see if the QR code sticker seems to have been placed above another one. Or if it looks like the QR code has been fiddled with. If you see either of these red flags, avoid using that QR code. </p><p>If you are ever unsure, do a quick look online to see if the service accepts QR codes. For example, there are reports from the USA of people being scammed by sending money through a QR code link placed on parking meters. Many parking apps don’t even use QR codes as part of their payment process, and these unfortunate people have been sending money directly to scammers.</p><h2>What if it’s too late?</h2><p>And if it’s too late, then don’t worry, you might be able to avoid losing money. </p><p>Remember that QR codes themselves aren’t dangerous. All technology can be exploited by those with bad intentions. Be vigilant with everything you do online!</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit,,Instagram India, Facebook,,,Instagram India, Facebook,,Instagram India, Facebook,Instagram India, Facebook,, Facebook,,TwitterTwitter IndiaTwitter India.

    "html": "<p>In response, we would like to assure all Truecaller users that their data is safe. Truecaller does not sell user data. We care deeply about our users and their data, and would like to assure them that we securely handle their data and process it as per our Privacy Policy.</p><p>We have stringent security and governance measures in place and a strong DNA in the company to do what is best for our users, period. We're building great things that continue to have a positive impact on millions of people around the world. And we will continue on our mission to build trust in communication.</p><p>Excerpt from the article  “They sent me another screenshot of a notification sent by Truecaller, which stated that my number was registered on WhatsApp.” \nTruecaller's response: This refers to an Android API which exists for user convenience. It’s there so that other apps can call or request for WhatsApp to be opened. We do not actually know if a user is on WhatsApp or not, we simply show the WhatsApp button as a convenience for users. We know that people use Truecaller to communicate with unsaved numbers so we simply try to invoke WhatsApp and lead the user to that point - to initiate a conversation.  This is a way for apps to link to each other - in no way does it share information. Literally any app developer can provide a button on their app to open WhatsApp the way we do.</p><p></p><p>Excerpt from the article: That we tap “free authentication of application-programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) as a data source” \nTruecaller's response: This is false. The main functionality of the SDK is to reduce friction in the sign up of an app by removing the ‘one-time password’ step. This is a convenience feature, built with user feedback, so that users can sign in to new services with a single tap. For developers, it offers a smoother onboarding of new users. The only thing they get is the verified name and phone number of the user.  \n\nExcerpt from the article: “If you want access to caller ID features and the app’s other functions, then you have to give up your contacts, so other users can access the same functions.” \nTruecaller's response: This is not true. We stay committed to providing the best user experience and being transparent about monetisation. All of Truecaller’s core features (caller ID, spam blocking, SMS categorisation and SMS spam blocking) remain free and unrestricted. Ads on our platform are the largest contributor towards revenues.\n\nExcerpt from the article: “In such cases (of pre-installs), most users have granted access to share the names, numbers, Google IDs, and email addresses of their contacts because a feature called “Enhanced Search” is auto-checked.” \nTruecaller's response: This is factually incorrect - Enhanced Search is never auto-checked and is consent driven irrespective of where the app is downloaded from.\n\nExcerpt from the article: “if someone has saved a spam phone number as “chor ka phone mat uthaiyo” — don’t pick up when this thief calls — it will be listed exactly like that in Truecaller’s database for global identification.” \nTruecaller's response: While it is true that there could be numbers with long, irrelevant or descriptive terms, it is something that we are constantly correcting. Our teams are constantly blacklisting offensive words used as names or descriptors in our Caller ID Services. The source of this information is what we call the ‘After Call Screen’. At the end of every call, we allow our users to correct or assign a name to the number from whom they received the call. Sometimes, users get creative with their names and this is something we do not encourage. \n\nExcerpt from the article: “your phone number — possibly with your professional identity — is ready to be viewed by the whole world.” \nTruecaller's response: This is not true because you cannot input a name into Truecaller and get a number. You can only input a number and get a likely name associated with that number. This could be a spammer, scammer, harasser or someone that you do want to receive calls from.   \n\nExcerpt from the article: “The SDK enables user verification of unregistered customers by making a dropped call—triggered by the user number in the background to complete the verification flow. It should be noted here that, due to the lack of stringent privacy laws, this option is currently available only in India.” \nTruecaller's response: This is not correct. In case the user is not a Truecaller user, he/she will have to manually enter their phone number in order to complete the onboarding process for a new service. Apart from India, the SDK is also available to developers and users globally. For instance, our own app Guardians can use the SDK to onboard users globally. Another example we can state is services like Jiji and Little Cabs in Kenya that also use the SDK.\n\nExcerpt from the article: “In June 2020, an assistant manager with a national bank, who did not want to be named because they did not want to jeopardize their safety, moved to Bangladesh to join a partner employed with India’s diplomatic mission. Once they reached Bangladesh, the regular SMS feature on their device stopped working due to the service provider’s rules, the bank employee told The Caravan. However, the bank employee was still receiving SMS notifications, including one-time passwords for every online transaction, through the Truecaller app installed on their phone. They shared screenshots of some of these messages with The Caravan, featuring the logo of the national bank, their bank balance, and the last four digits of the account number on every message. This leads to the question of whether Truecaller has access to SMS content and is able to witness every “secret handshake” — OTP-based financial transactions — with a bank.”\nTruecaller's response: This is incorrect. Truecaller never reads your SMS messages. Truecaller works like any other SMS application and only displays SMSes that are received on the mobile device via the network carrier. This is the only source for the SMS that is visible in the Truecaller application.</p><p>All SMS features such as the categoriser (automatic sorting of SMS under different heads), built in spam/scam protection, automatic reminders (for bill payments), smart cards (only useful information, presented in an easy-to-read format), inbox cleaner (automatic clean up of old OTPs and junk) and grouping of SMS with correct sender names & company logos - are all built using machine learning models that are designed to work on the user's device locally. All the processed information remains securely on your device and is not uploaded anywhere.</p><p>On background - you can read more about it in the article Can Truecaller read my messages? </p><p>Excerpt from the article: “Apart from tracking your calls, their duration, and your most and least favorite contacts, the Truecaller software can build your detailed financial profile, as it has access to your SMS [messages],” the former employee said. They confirmed that the company’s algorithm can read the content of text messages. “With a special feature called ‘SMS categorizer,’ the Truecaller software is able to recognize personal, high-priority [bank OTPs and transactions], and also spam messages of its registered user.” This ability, they added, could allow the app to send loan offers to people when their bank balance goes below a certain number. Truecaller already has a short-term loan offer up to 5 lakh rupees (around $6,600) for registered users without much paperwork. The company also has a financial partnership with firms such as WhizDM Innovations, which offers personal loans. \nTruecaller's response: This is false - Truecaller is not interested in building or collecting financial profiles of its users. Truecaller exited the UPI and payments business in March 2021. It is true that Truecaller, at one point, offered digital loans through NBFC partners as a trial (based on consumer request). This option is not available anymore. Users interested in availing personal loans would have to agree to provide certain documents to the NBFC partners and explicitly agree to provide their phone number for purposes of a credit check. Truecaller did not have access to and nor did it store any of this information.  </p><p>For more information, reach out to support@truecaller.com.</p>"

    "html": "<h2>What is a Social Connection?</h2><p>Let’s start from the beginning. A social connection is a connection between people, or in our case, phone numbers. We know of the natural kind of connection – you know the person behind the number – you call this person Jenny, and they pick up the call. If Jenny then calls another person – let’s name him Kumar, and they have been talking to each other, we can assume they might know each other. So when Kumar calls you, Voilá – someone you might know is calling you! That is Truecaller’s social connection, simplified.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NDM1Yjg0NDktMjgzMS00OTUyLTk1N2ItZDIwZTU0YTRkNGZi_8afdd4d5-8a77-4b59-af3c-6f634ce582d5_socialconnections.gif?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,800,449&w=800&h=449\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" /><h2>How we used to get to know new people</h2><p>The way we used to meet people has changed throughout the years. In the 1940s we had to rely on our family to introduce us, or settling with befriending our neighbours. No harm in that, your neighbour could be your new best friend.</p><p>We’ve met new people through various communities, like in church or by starting a new job. Then the computers came along and with that we started meeting online. With social media, our world of friends got bigger again, when we could talk to people who shared the same interests. At the same time as we understood how big the world were, we also felt how the world became smaller and friendlier with these new friends.</p><h2>Friend or foe – the guessing game</h2><p>Getting a call that’s not in your contact list could be anything from a new friend, to a real life spammer trying to trick you. With the help of the Truecaller Community these calls should be identified, or at least reported as a spam. With almost 8 billion phone numbers in the world, the guessing game is strong, even with a community of over 300 million people.</p><h2>Your Caller ID gives you all the info you need</h2><p>When a spammer is calling you the phone screen turns red or gives you the information that it’s a possible spam call. This is also the case for a Verified Business call that shows a green screen, and Priority caller, that shows up purple. The more information you have before answering a call, the better. Like Call Reason. All of these things give you the information you need when deciding whether or not to pick up a call.</p><p>Don't worry if you miss the call. You can even do a phone number search to understand who called you!</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OTA1Y2Y2ZjYtNzEwZi00MWZmLWEwMWUtZThiMWE0MjQwMTI5_24487ade-6f2d-4155-be1d-6a97823753db_socialconnections-blog2.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>Useful information from Social Connections</h2><p>We’ve already talked about ‘Someone you might know’ but we will also make it even more useful for you when it comes to deciding to pick up the call or not.</p><p>If a number has been marked as spam by your connections, we’ll tell you that as a warning, as well if many of your connections has picked up a phone call from a number, we’ll mark it as ‘Likely important’. When a number calls you that is not in your phone book but has a mutual connection for many of your connections, we’ll be able to tell you that as well.</p><h2>Making tomorrow’s communication smarter, safer, and more efficient</h2><p>We believe that the more you know about how Truecaller works, the better for you. That’s why we make sure to tell you how our features work. Especially when they work like magic – like Smart SMS. We also want to make sure that you know all there is to know about different kinds of spam, and that you are important for everyone in the Truecaller community, just by simply reporting a number.</p><p>Also, update your Truecaller app! With a community of over 300 million people using Truecaller every month, Truecaller offers a great communication experience.</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Instagram India, Instagram Indonesia, Facebook, TikTok, TikTok Indonesia, Twitter, and Twitter India.

    "html": "<h2>What does your typical day look like?</h2><p>I am a big fan of a structured workday. But no day is ever the same 🙂 </p><p>My day as a Human Resources Director involves employee 1:1s, group meetings, onboarding calls with new joiners to help managers solve people challenges, and brainstorming sessions with my team to see how we can do things better and evolve.</p><h2>What is the most rewarding aspect of what you do?</h2><p>On the one hand, I like how my role plays a critical part in developing our organisation’s culture. I have the opportunity to facilitate communication between our managers and employees, helping to provide solutions to make a difference in the work environment.</p><p>On the other hand, every day I have the chance to create meaningful and lasting relationships and solve complex problems that could impact people’s lives.</p><h2>What are the main challenges of a Human Resources Director? How did you overcome them?</h2><p>2020 presented some of the most challenging times for employees and HR leaders. The pandemic forced companies to address technology challenges to enable remote work. It was no different for us at Truecaller. </p><p>The challenge of maintaining a uniform company culture with a dispersed workforce was/is not trivial. We tackle this problem with trustful and proactive communication. We ensured we took care of our new joiners by strengthening our virtual onboarding to ensure they felt welcomed.</p><p>Also, we introduced employee connect initiatives, manager check-ins, medical facilities, time offs, wellness initiatives, etc.</p><h2>What do you think is essential for companies to create an inclusive environment for women in tech?</h2><li>Culture. It is essential to think about what sort of culture we need to build and all the elements required to create an inclusive and belonging culture.</li><li>Creating safe places to receive feedback. We should provide channels for honest communication and be open to listening and receiving truthful feedback.</li><li>Internal development programs – reskilling and upskilling. </li><li>Focused and planned communication to clarify and bring more commitment to Leadership.</li><li>External /Internal female mentors, coaches, and role models. Companies can invest in career mapping and 1-on-1 mentorships to help empower and support women in tech.</li><li>Affinity Groups for networking, development, and visibility.</li><li>Support groups outside the organisations. Provide development opportunities to increase women’s leadership pipeline. Bring ‘the outside-in approach’ for development.</li><h2>Why is it necessary to have more women in tech?</h2><p>In a competitive market where half of the world’s population is women, tech companies cannot afford to overlook the importance of female contributions as clients, customers, decision-makers, and end-users.</p><p>Also, having various teams feeds creativity and innovation. To sum up, a work environment of diverse people means different methods and strategies of thinking.</p><h2>As a Human Resources Director, how would you describe Truecaller culture?</h2><p>At Truecaller, we have a culture of innovation and passion. An environment where people can grow, have fun, and do their best work. All of this keeps all of us staying true to our core values.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OGMxODVlZmQtYTcxNS00ZWFiLTkzMzEtZjUxMjRkMWY2M2E5_22ddbd4a-10c7-4b0f-bcbb-bfe96a737fa2_humerablog128229.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1350&w=2400&h=1350\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" /><h2>Tell me some beneficial things that Truecaller does for women within the organisation. </h2><p>There is a constant strive to make Truecaller a great place to work for everyone but specifically for women. We have monthly women’s meet-ups, and we ensure our policies are gender-neutral and progressive to attract more females to choose Truecaller for their Career Move.</p><p>Moreover, to help bring awareness and create a gender-sensitive culture, we have partnered with the Swedish Chamber of Commerce. This task force on gender sensitisation is uniquely a first, fully conceptualised and executed by Kraftsamla, Swedish Chamber of Commerce India.</p><h2>What is the most important thing you learned as a Human Resources Director?</h2><p>Change is the only constant, and you need to adapt accordingly by being resilient to change. Be fearless and never give up!</p><h2>Do you have any advice for women entering male-dominated fields?</h2><p>Women are limitless and can be who they want to be. They must build confidence to overcome pressure while dealing with others. They shouldn’t be afraid to challenge the norm and work together.</p><p>Information technology is not only one of the fastest-growing industries, but it is also pivotal to the changes in civilisation. Furthermore, education is one of the main reasons women are underrepresented in the tech industry. Current research shows fewer females are studying in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) compared to their male counterparts. So, we must encourage and help girls starting in those fields receive mentorship or role models from those already in those industries.</p><p>Do you want to build a career in tech?</p><p>You can find more stories on our blog, connect with us on Linkedin, follow our “Behind the Code” series on Youtube, and discover what it is like working at Truecaller on Instagram.</p>"

You might pose a valid question: ‘If Truecaller is doing all this, why have so many people lost money?’ Unfortunately, they were probably not using Truecaller for SMS (or not using Truecaller at all), so they were never warned.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MWE1OGZkNzctZDAyYi00ODU3LThiMmMtNGNiNzdhMjk0MWJk_0f126cbe-f921-4fde-8474-3219f8123a05_scamalert_electricityscamsinindia-2.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2448,1950&w=2448&h=1950\" alt=\"\" width=\"2448\" height=\"1950\" /><p>Our privacy-by-design principles mean that we can’t read or access any of the text messages stored on a user’s device by default. Only when a user reports a spam or scam message on the app can we process such messages for blacklisting the reported sender, warning users of potential fraud, and further strengthening our fraud and spam/scam detection system.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NWY3YjZlYWYtOTJmOS00NWI2LWExYWMtMzk2NTQ3NjFiYzhl_dcfb235e-121f-4056-8ea9-40d5afebcb75_scamalert_electricityscamsinindia-3.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2448,1650&w=2448&h=1650\" alt=\"\" width=\"2448\" height=\"1650\" /><h2>How this scam works</h2><p>Most electricity scams have a simple message, albeit poorly worded and full of incorrect spellings. Dear consumer, you haven’t paid your electricity bill or if you have, it’s not reflected in our systems. Please call the electricity officer to verify your payment and avoid disconnection. The threat of disconnection also typically comes with a prompt to act fast because the supply will be cut off at 9:30 or 10:30pm. If someone calls the listed number, the polite ‘electricity officer’ will be more than willing to help because he wouldn’t want anyone to be inconvenienced without power for the entire night, especially during the hot Indian summers. They will typically get the victim to download a screen-sharing app and very easily clean out their bank account in a manner of minutes. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>Why are people falling for these scams?</h2><p>There’s a simple rule of thumb when it comes to scams: the scammers prefer to send these texts in high volumes because there will always be a tiny percentage (possibly even lower than 1%) of people who fall for it and call the listed number. There’s nothing terribly scientific about it and no social engineering or precise targeting is going on. It’s just a bit of fear-mongering because no one wants to lose access to electricity and that is too late in the evening when chances of a resolution are minimal. These scams have high gains for very little effort. The scammers minimise the risk of consequences by expertly covering their tracks, transferring money to digital wallets instead of bank accounts, and quickly changing phone numbers.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How to recognise these scams </h2><p>If you’re reading this blog, you already know how to spot such scams. But not everyone you know will be as clued in. It’s worth repeating that if you receive any text message from a service you use, it should have your name, a consumer ID, or a masked account number that shows the message is intended only for you. As we mentioned earlier, scam messages intentionally have typos and substitute certain letters with numbers to avoid detection by telecom operators and the built-in scam detection services used by smartphone manufacturers. Look for very obvious incorrect use of exclamation marks and special characters, irregular spacing between words, colloquial language and abbreviations (like Plz and Ur), some sense of urgency, and even threats. </p><h3>\nSome examples:</h3>Your electricity P0wer will be disconnected 10.30 pm because your b!II not updated. Contact power office <phone number>NOTICE Dear costomer your previous electricity bill was not updated your electriccity will disconnect Tonight call electr!city office <phone number> Thanks youNotification Dear consumer Your Electricity Power will be disconnected Tonight at 9.30 pm from electricity Office.because your previous month bill was not update please immediately contacttst with Our electricity officer <phone number> Thank youNotification Dear Customer Your Electricity powar will be disconnected Tonight at 9.30 pm from electricity office.because your previous month bill was not update please immediately contact with our electricity <phone number> Thank you call nowDear Customer Ur El3ctricity wiII be Disconnected Tonight at TIME Ur previous Month biII was not Update Plz call urgent <phone number> Thanku81262   <p></p><p></p><h2>How you can help</h2><p>Not everyone can spot scams - a fact that scammers rely on.

Outside of work, you will find Ravi watching movies, reading fiction, and figuring out how gadgets work — in fact, he used to review smartphones for a living at one point. As a technology lover, Ravi will be responsible for finding the right data partners who can help bridge the gap in Truecaller’s database.</p><p>Do you want to know more? Let’s dive in!</p><h2>Why did you decide to join Truecaller?</h2><p>I have been a Truecaller user since I got my first smartphone over a decade ago. I have seen how much of a difference it can make in the lives of its users. But the factor that attracted me the most is its growth potential – 310 million users is a huge number for most companies. Now I have the opportunity to work as a Growth Product Manager and help scale it to 500 million, 1 billion, and even more!</p><h2>You recently moved from India to Stockholm. What is your first impression of the city? What are you going to miss the most about India?</h2><p>I landed in Stockholm 3 weeks ago, and it was windy and chilly compared to India – but I love that! On the first day of our arrival, my wife and I went to Gamla Stan to check out the lovely medieval architecture, and we haven’t stopped since. Everyone keeps telling me I have landed here at the best time of the year as the weather only gets better from here.</p><p>The one thing I will miss about India is the street food – but I have heard there are a couple of good places in Stockholm. I will be visiting those soon!</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YTJiYmMwZjItZDI4NC00NjM4LTg0ZDktZjMzYTJhODhkODBh_13d96fc5-5488-49f5-ac3c-7c443cb77076_dsc00365.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,4240,2385&w=4240&h=2385\" alt=\"\" width=\"4240\" height=\"2385\" /><h2>Tell us about your first day at Truecaller.</h2><p>My first day at Truecaller was when I was working remotely from India, so I was apprehensive about how the remote onboarding process will be. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly everything went.</p><h2>How did you experience the 3-days office onboarding?</h2><p>I had landed in Stockholm by the time the 3-day onboarding process started, so I could meet other people who joined Truecaller recently and learn about them and the organization. The experience was illuminating and helpful to anyone who entered the company.</p><h2>What first impression did you get from the company? And the team?</h2><p>In my mind, the two words that describe Truecaller – the company and the team – are Collaborative and Supportive. Everyone I have encountered so far has been very cooperative and helped me learn the processes so I can get up to speed and contribute to the growth of Truecaller.</p><p>At Truecaller, when a new employee joins the company, they get a TrueBuddy. A buddy is a person who can help the new joiner settle in and support them in any way with their knowledge and experience. The buddy helps them understand the culture of Truecaller and ensures they feel part of the team.</p><h2>How has your TrueBuddy been supporting you through the onboarding process?</h2><p>Bharat Singh from the Search team was assigned as my TrueBuddy and approached me via Slack on my first day at Truecaller. We had a 1-hour call in which he told me about Truecaller, his experience here, and asked about me and my role. When I landed in Stockholm, we chatted about what to see in the city and the people in Truecaller I should talk to for help. He has been helpful and has made my joining experience very seamless!</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YzlmYzQyZmYtODc0Zi00OTU3LThlMDUtZjhmZTRiOTIzNDQ4_dc3c3052-5b7b-444e-810e-bb58d026b35e_dsc00342-2.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,4240,2385&w=4240&h=2385\" alt=\"\" width=\"4240\" height=\"2385\" /><h2>What would you highlight so far about the Truecaller culture?</h2><p>I have noticed how proud everyone here is of their work and the company. Whether it is the more technical BUs or the external-facing entities like Brand, everyone I have met so far has been very proud while talking about what they do to make Truecaller better every day.</p><h2>What do you look forward to now that your career at Truecaller has begun?</h2><p>Truecaller is in a unique position – it is the undisputed market leader in the Caller ID and spam-prevention domain, but it also has unlimited growth potential. With over 6 billion smartphones worldwide, our work has just begun – and I hope to be one of the key drivers of the next growth stage. </p><h2>What do you think is essential for companies to build a great onboarding experience?</h2><p>One difference between my onboarding at Truecaller and the previous organizations in which I worked was how involved everyone was in the process. Not just the HR team but the management team, Brand, and other departments. On top of that, the company made the onboarding process smoother for an introvert like me by assigning a TrueBuddy who helped me familiarize myself with the people and methods so that I don’t feel lost in my early days here. This has been essential for my great onboarding experience at Truecaller. It is something that all companies should adopt. </p><p>Do you want to build a career that you love?</p><p>You can find more stories on our blog, connect with us on Linkedin, follow our “Behind the Code” series on Youtube, and discover what it is like working at Truecaller on Instagram.</p>"

This will help users seamlessly connect with the government by giving easy access to verified contacts of government officials. From national helpline numbers to numbers for ministries and bureaucrats, you now have verified contacts of key government officials and authorities at your fingertips. Currently, we have covered around 20 central government ministries, over 23 states, and union territories, and the information has been sourced directly from the government and official government sources.</p><p>Based on feedback from the Truecaller community, we have learnt that one of the most pervasive phone scams involves the impersonation of government officials. The creation of a verified government contact directory is a continuation of our efforts to build trust in communication and protect our users from fraud and scams. \n\nWhen the phone rings, you will see a green background and a blue tick, indicating that the number is verified. This way, the new feature will also protect you from scammers who may spoof the name of government service providers, thus protecting you from the impact and harm of impersonation.</p><p>With this initiative, we hope to help streamline public access to government representatives and assist our over 240 million Indian users in connecting with the government in a hassle-free manner. We will keep updating the feature in the upcoming months with more verified numbers across different departments and states.\n</p><p>The government services digital directory is now available in India for Android phones!

    "html": "<p>Access the full report at: https://tclr.se/US2022Report</p><p>How to best Prevent Spam (According to Truecaller):\nAt Truecaller, we believe our solution for blocking spam is superior. A mixture of a strong, community-based system combined with advanced machine learning, provides the best protection for people across the world. We’ve learnt over the years that scammers and spammers are crafty. When regulation or laws pop-up, they find ways around them. That is why there is no quick or easy fix to scams, unless you harness the power of a community like Truecaller’s. </p><h2>US Spam and Scam Report – Introduction</h2><p>Key Findings</p>As many as 68.4M Americans (26%) report losing money from phone scams – up from 59.4 million (23%) in 2021.1 in 3 Americans (33%) report having ever fallen victim to phone scams, with 20% more than once.\n\nOf those who lost money to phone scams in the past 12 months:The average reported loss was $577 – up from $502 in 2021.Robocallers duped 61.1% of these people.\nThe money lost to scam calls in the past 12 months equates to an estimated $39.5 billion USD*.The number of spam calls received by Americans actually increased (albeit marginally) compared to the previous year. This indicates that the STIR/SHAKEN protocols have not had the desired effect.Hispanics are more vulnerable to scams. 28.5 million Hispanics (46%) report falling victim to phone scams compared to 33% of the general population.When scammed, 43% of people take the immediate step of finding and downloading a spam blocker and/or caller ID app.Spammers appear to be using text messages far more this year. Spam texts have more than doubled over the previous 3 years. Males over 65 years old are the biggest targets.\n<h2>68.4 million Americans have fallen victim to a phone scam in the past 12 months</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NGUyNmM4MWItNDhhNi00OTM0LWEzM2QtN2UzNDIwYWNiYTVl_2fca3242-fd77-464e-abe6-e9941f6147a9_totalamericansthatlostmoneytoscamcalls.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2232,1566&w=2232&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2232\" height=\"1566\" /><p>In the past 12 months, over 68.4 million Americans lost money to phone scams. This is a clear increase compared to last year’s 59.4 million and 56 million from 2020. Once again, this is the highest number recorded since we started researching scam and spam calls in the US 8 years ago.</p><p>This is also despite Congress mandating the STIR/SHAKEN framework.This set of standards was supposed to protect Americans from robocallers and scammers. Unfortunately, it looks like scammers are finding ways to sidestep regulation by the government, and continue to defraud more people of their money. </p><h2>Losses to phone scams totalled $39.5 billion USD in the past 12 months</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MzUwNmEyZDgtMTEyOC00MjkxLWE0NDctYzEzMzhjMWZkZjlh_79bd6a0c-6273-400d-bda1-fb9994005069_totalmoneylosttoscamcalls.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2232,1566&w=2232&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2232\" height=\"1566\" /><p>Over the past eight years, the total money lost to scam calls in the US has been growing significantly. In just the past 12 months, an estimated $39.5 billion USD* was lost to phone scams. This is a 32.5% increase compared to last year’s $29.8 billion USD. </p><p>To put this into perspective, $39.5 billion is the same amount of money as giving $1000 dollars to every person in California.</p><p>The total money lost to scams is also comparable to the American Rescue Plan Act’s entire childcare budget of $39 billion. If phone scam fraud was somehow eliminated, the amount saved could fund federally subsidized child care across the U.S. for a full year to help families and employers.</p><h2>The average reported loss to scam calls has increased 14.9% in the past 12 months</h2><p>Among those affected by scam calls, the average money lost was $577 USD. This is a 14.9% increase compared to last year ($502 USD).</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OWFkN2JkY2MtNTZmMC00OTM0LTk1NzctNmE4OTJiYTljY2Ix_1bc6836e-a047-4a56-b4fb-de0f251011d7_averagemoneylosttoscamcalls.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2180,1566&w=2180&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2180\" height=\"1566\" /><p>The graph above shows the trend over the past eight years. While there was a downward trend in 2015 and 2019, the past 12 months have recorded the highest ever average amount of money lost to phone scams.  </p><h2>Scams from robocalls remain a big problem in the U.S. </h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YmVlYzMzYWEtZDBiNC00NGUyLWIwOWMtZTNkMmUwNGJlZDFk_57d560a8-24dd-440c-ac67-b8d2ce1c8ae8_victimsthatlostmoneybecauseofarobocallscam.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1942,1566&w=1942&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"1942\" height=\"1566\" /><p>The number of victims who lose money to a robocall scam continues to be a big problem. 3 in 5 Americans who have lost money to phone scams (61.1%) admit to losing money as the direct result of a robocall. Just a friendly reminder here, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) , any robocall trying to sell you something is illegal. The only exception is if the caller has written permission, directly from you, to call you in this way.</p><p>The FTC also states that even if you have given such permission to a company in the past, you always retain the right to revoke that permission at any time. </p><h2>Men more likely than women to be scammed</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZjdjN2QxZDYtNTQ4ZC00OTJmLTgyOTktNTZmZDQyMTUwNTM1_51f130cf-0ad3-4a67-9064-bf6f82309449_scamvictimsbygender.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2214,1566&w=2214&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2214\" height=\"1566\" /><p>In the past 12 months, of those who have been victim to phone scams, 55.6% were men and 42.2% were women. The rest (2.3%) of those who participated identify as non-binary or preferred not to reveal their gender. </p><h2>Similar to previous years, younger men and women between the ages of 18-44 years are more susceptible to phone scams</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OGQ1YjI0NDQtNGMzNC00MDAzLTg5OWItNzEzMzI0NTZkOGRj_7210f07f-2aab-4af6-bb0c-f812fbedcbce_scamvictimsbygenderandagebracket.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1942,1566&w=1942&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"1942\" height=\"1566\" /><p>Younger men are more likely than older men to lose money to a phone scam, particularly men aged 18-34 (46%) and age 35-44 (51%), compared to men aged 45-54 (24%). Among women, the age groups that are most susceptible are also 18-34 years olds (34%) and 35-44 year olds (32%).</p><h2>Downloading a spam blocker/caller ID app continues to be the predominant action after being scammed</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZTI3ZmI3ZGEtNThiNC00ZWNmLWFlODEtN2YwMjlmYjlmZTk3_5b3db9a8-d521-456f-a888-f1381603059a_actionstakenafterbeingscammed.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,3600,2458&w=3600&h=2458\" alt=\"\" width=\"3600\" height=\"2458\" /><p>When scammed, 43% of people downloaded a spam blocker and/or caller ID app. 37% took the inconvenient step of canceling their credit card/changing account numbers. Another 30% took the trouble of reporting the scam to the authorities.</p><p>When money is lost to a phone scam, higher income groups are more likely to take action (99% vs. 88% for household income less than $50K). This trend increases in groups along with an increase in income. </p><p>Despite these actions, a new question from this year’s research has revealed that: 25% say they have missed legitimate calls because of brute-force blocking (i.e., extreme and inaccurate spam filtering). This shows that many spam filters are not working effectively, and are not building more trust in communication, but in fact the opposite. It also proves that improved caller identification, more precise spam analytics and future innovation within call screening is important to improving the communication environment within the country.</p><h2>On average, Americans received nearly 31 spam calls per user per month. This is slightly above the average of 30.7 calls per user per month in the previous year</h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZWY3ZWEzYWQtMDQwYi00MDljLThiNzgtMTg2Nzg4OWVjMWZl_eb2628e1-d76f-4c2e-a953-8780d7126c50_monthlyspamrecieved.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2104,1566&w=2104&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2104\" height=\"1566\" /><h2>Key Spam Stats from the 2022 US Spam and Scam Report</h2><p>This year, Americans received 31 spam calls in an average month (no significant increase from 30.7 in 2021). Of these, 21.5 on average were robocalls.</p><p>Nearly 3 in 5 Americans (58%) reported receiving more spam calls and/or text messages than they did a year ago. 14% said they received fewer.</p><p>Nearly 9 in 10 (86%) said they try to only answer calls if they can identify the person or business calling. This clearly highlights the need for an efficient and accurate caller ID service.</p><p>The average number of spam texts per month is 19.5, continuing significant year-on-year increases since 2019 (16.9 in 2021,14.7 in 2020, 10.6 in 2019 and 8.5 in 2018).</p><p>If they received a call from an unknown number, 67% of Americans would completely ignore it. If they received a text from an unknown number, 65% of Americans said they would delete it. </p><h2>New Data in the 2022 US Spam and Scam Report</h2>Demographics – Ethnicity<p>In 2022, we added extra data to help further understand who are most vulnerable to spams and scams. Part of this was research into the racial breakdown of spam and scam victims.</p><p>Analysis found that Hispanics, although they receive less spam calls and texts when compared to Black and White respondents, were more likely to have been a victim of a phone scam in their lifetime. Hispanics also report that when they lost money (due to a phone scam), it was mostly by a robocall. This stat showed a surprisingly large difference, 74% compared to 43% and 65% of Black and White adults respectively. Based on their responses, it is observed that CallerID accuracy for the Hispanic population is comparatively less (47% vs 54% & 53% for Black and White respectively).</p>Call from an unknown number<p>With respect to race/ethnicity, Whites (Non Hispanics) are more likely to answer a call if they can identify the person or business they are calling from compared to Black(Non Hispanics) and Hispanics (89% vs. 82% and 81%) .</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MDRlYTAwYzktM2RlMS00Y2FjLTg1NGYtMjU2YTRjZDU1MDdk_79408527-064d-4da2-9ca9-d6b0b1711a06_likelytoonlyanswercallsifthenumberisidentified.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2104,1566&w=2104&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2104\" height=\"1566\" /><h2>Neighbor Spoofing </h2><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NThjOTc3ZTItNTkyYi00YTQ4LWExMDQtMDVkYjk0ZDdiZDZh_eb6d1f7f-f622-4733-8cec-9dcc515d9b98_neighborspoofing.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2214,1566&w=2214&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2214\" height=\"1566\" /><p>We asked respondents if the number of spam calls they receive with a spoofed location (i.e., neighbor spoofing, or spam calls displaying your area code) has increased, decreased or stayed the same in the past 12 months.</p><p>Just over half of Americans (51%) report that the number of spam calls they receive with neighbor spoofing has increased in the past 12 months. 35% said it stayed the same. Only 7% report a decrease in these types of calls. This is surprising to us. After the Stir/Shaken protocol was mandated, we were expecting a reduction in neighbor spoofing. Although it is a step in the right direction for legislation, it is clear that Stir/Shaken has been somewhat ineffective.\n\nFrom our analysis, it seems that with an increase in age, household income or higher education, Americans receive more spam calls from the same area code.\n\nThe research revealed that adults above 35 years of age are more likely than those between 18-34 to report an increase in this type of call (56% vs. 39%). Those with a household income (HHI) of $75k+ are more likely than those with HHI of less than $50k to report an increase in this type of call (56% vs. 46%). Those with college education are more likely than those with higher secondary education (or less) to report an increase (56% vs. 43%).</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YTY4MDc1MTktZTM1Ni00MmMzLWIyYmMtZjUxYjZiYmM4OTEw_8dc007ce-08fd-415e-95f5-5b82c2ed82d2_howlikelyarerespondentstopickupacallfromanidentifiednumber_.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2104,1566&w=2104&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2104\" height=\"1566\" /><p>This year, we asked if respondents are more likely to answer calls from an unknown number if they are clearly identified as an important organization (for instance, a school, business, hospital, airline, contractor, delivery and so on).</p><p>65% of Americans say they are more likely to answer calls from an unknown number if they are clearly identified as important organizations.\n\nYounger men and women (18-44) are more likely to answer calls from an unknown number if they are clearly identified as important organizations (76% vs. 56% ages 45+).</p><h2>US Spam and Scam Report </h2><p>Communication is changing </p><p>A whopping 86% of Americans try to only answer calls if they can identify the person or business they are calling from. Getting in touch via calls is now becoming socially less acceptable.\n\n60% of Americans prefer to use other methods for communicating (e.g., text, social media apps, email) to avoid phone calls altogether. This could indicate many things, such as:\n\n1. Spam phone calls and robocalls have created an environment of great distrust among society with this method of communication.</p><p>2. Modern forms of communicating, that require less immediacy are more preferred than being put on the spot by a phone call.\n</p><p>As to the exact reasons for the aforementioned stats, that is unclear. But despite the majority of people only answering calls from known numbers, they may miss legitimate calls because they suspect they are spam and don’t answer.\n\n\nMore than half (51%) of Americans find it difficult to reach other people via phone calls because many ignore phone calls in an effort to avoid spam.</p><p>At Truecaller, this represents a large need, and validation, for our efforts in identifying and verifying callers.\n</p><h2>Robocalls and Robotexts</h2><p>Overall, 97% of Americans say they have received a robocall. 3% say they haven’t received any robocall in the past 12 months.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NWNiOTQ3Y2QtODY3My00NDE3LThkZTMtMGZmZDc5Y2EyNDg3_06aadae9-35ac-476e-af84-7e388ead4bdb_typesofrobocallsreceivedbyamericans.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2180,1566&w=2180&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2180\" height=\"1566\" /><p>According to the survey, vehicle warranties (60%) tops the list of types of robocalls Americans have received in the past 12 months.

Younger adults are also more susceptible to robocall scams.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MjU2ZWRjMTgtN2I2Yy00NGU4LTg5NWEtOTIzOGYxMGU1M2Qx_f74cd1b3-7e6a-410a-9a51-4a2f91539921_spamcallsandspammessagesreceivedbyage.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2104,1566&w=2104&h=1566\" alt=\"\" width=\"2104\" height=\"1566\" />Text Spam has more than doubled in the last 3 years.

With Truecaller, we safeguard people in their digital lives. With Guardians, it’s for personal safety, and now we’re focusing on enabling fun, impromptu digital audio conversations. And the best part? No rooms, no invites, no recording tools - everyone is invited, and your number stays private.</p><p>No one wants to miss out on the gossip, the reminiscing about old times, or the latest gathering that’s in the works. That’s why we’ve created a new way to have conversations, get everyone involved, and even get to know your friends’ buddies in a fun way. Our doors are always open!\n</p><p></p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YzI5YmFmYTItZTIyYS00YTVlLThiM2EtMjM3OWRkZWE3OGVi_87b0fbda-68a9-4c0e-b907-760a8e6a13be_opendoors-screens.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1490&w=2400&h=1490\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1490\" /><p></p><h2>How to use Open Doors - The Newest Social Audio App</h2><p>Sign up: Use your phone number to sign up (If you're already a Truecaller user, you can sign in with just one tap). Don’t worry, your phone number is never shown to other people in the app.</p><p>Start talking: The app is simple. You start the conversation, and friends in your contact book who have the app will also have the opportunity to join in and not miss out. The more friends who join, their friends are also alerted, and the wider your conversation reaches!\n\nEmoji mania! Get your trigger finger ready with animated emoji explosions to add more visual fun. 🤣🥳😍\n\nMuting rules: If you are unhappy with any other participant in the conversation, you can simply mute them. As a next step, you can also block/report others if their speech is offensive or against our community guidelines. If multiple people report the same person, Open Doors will eventually ban the person from using the app</p><p>Common Questions</p><p>What permissions does Open Doors need?</p><p>The app needs only two permissions: Contacts (so that you can share Open Doors, or have conversations with people in your contacts who also have Open Doors) and phone permission (needed to have audio conversations). Participants in a conversation cannot see each other's phone number.</p><p>You are in control:</p><p>As a user of Open Doors, you are in complete control at all times. You can start a conversation and leave at will. Your friends can join conversations when they get a notification or by clicking on a link you share.\n\nOnce your friend joins the conversation, their friends will be invited too. Through the network effect, the amount of people in the conversation is endless. \n\nIs there moderation?</p><p>Conversations are real-time and moderated by the community, just like Truecaller. Conversations are never stored or recorded, and no one can listen in without you knowing. We expect participants to foster a safe, inclusive and respectful environment during conversations. </p><p>New improvements</p><p>Based on user feedback, we will keep innovating and adding more features to Open Doors. Some innovations that are already in the works, thanks to a small beta tester group, are the ability to set a close circle of contacts (so that others in your contacts who have Open Doors will not always get a notification when you start a conversation), the ability to react to what people are saying and precise control over how the app notifies you of new conversations. </p><p>Open Doors is available for Android and iPhone on your app store: https://opndrs.page.link/blog</p>"

    "html": "<p>Do yourself a favor and review this list. It might save you from losing a lot of money.</p><h2>The latest top 10 IRS scams:</h2><h3>1. Threatening a Lawsuit</h3><p>\nThe IRS lawsuit scam is one of the most common that American taxpayers face, and millions are lost each year to them. Scammers use email, phone calls and even regular mail to pretend to be the IRS, but a lot of the time it is an IRS email scam. They will threaten lawsuits for not complying and will try and get you to settle by paying money directly.</p><p></p><h3>2. IRS Scam Robocall</h3><p>\nThe most common of these scams, often with threats of lawsuits, comes in the form of an automated ‘robocall’. The recording is an automated voice that says the IRS is filing a lawsuit against you, and to call back to a certain number. (Hint, it’s not the real IRS). With robocalls like this, they are able to quickly target millions of taxpayers over their mobile devices, with high chances that some unlucky folks will fall for it. But, does the IRS call you? Sometimes, but expect to have correspondence by mail (refer to previous paragraph).\n</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MmE1ODc5N2ItNjRlOS00OGRlLTg3ZWItZjhjNWU1ZTk4Zjdk_mgjmmzi3ndutmdg1ys00y2ewlwewnzmtzjjhzti5odc3zdll_phrase-irs-internal-revenue-service-truecaller-scams-1-1.jpgresize7002c394ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,394&w=700&h=394\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /><h3>3. Social Security Account number IRS Scam</h3><p>\nYour Social Security number, or SSN, is amongst the most sensitive of your personal details. The SSAN tax scam is carried out by scammers threatening to suspend or cancel the victim’s SSN if demands aren’t met. What makes this a tax-related scam is that scammers may mention overdue taxes in addition to threatening to cancel the person’s SSN. In an IRS email scam like this, they will try to sound official, often using pre-recorded robocalls. This is to scare you into parting with your money or private info. Hint: Nobody can ‘cancel’ your SSAN, not even the federal government.  You’re stuck with this identifier, for life.</p><p></p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h3>4. Ghost Tax Return Scam</h3><p>\nThis is a common scam where someone pretending to be a proper tax preparer will assist you with your taxes but will not sign the tax return they prepare (which is a standard practice for anyone who helps you with your taxes). They can also be called ‘ghost preparers.’ They may then organize for the tax refund to go into their bank account, not yours! Check for proper credentials when using tax professionals.  Never hand over your tax files to anyone not certified in your jurisdiction.  Check licensing!</p><h3>5. Pandemic (COVID-19) Related Tax Fraud Schemes\n</h3><p>Many reports have emerged of scammers attempting to defraud people by suggesting misuse of pandemic related assistance, Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), or stimulus packages. In a classic ‘Phishing’ style attack, they will pretend to be from the IRS, the Treasury Department or even law enforcement agencies. They will ask for payment, often in the form of debit cards, gift cards or asking for bank accounts and routing numbers.  This is quite often a phone IRS scam. Be smart!</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/NWUyZjY5NTQtY2U5NC00Nzc0LThhZmItYTVmNWQwZjQzNDJm_m1mjm4ogjly2m5_ecoavi4j_4rqfigtgdmgs2jkcbfdo9ciyuejlegg32o1u-jdny-b9chtomuvyp1t_o1gslvz5a9hug_pkrf3ult46biko7imogjitg4udtjbikvg14ermn0t-kzhu3qswhp97flv?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1600,1056&w=1600&h=1056\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1056\" /><h3>6. Interest and Penalty Free Extensions for a Discount/Fee</h3><p>\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The IRS will allow ‘relief’ from payment obligations for certain circumstances, but remember this: The IRS is not in the business of discounts, they are a government agency.\n</p><p>Cryptocurrency-Related Tax Scams\nScams involving cryptocurrency have exploded in recent years. Justice.gov defines these as: So, the range of cryptocurrency scams is large. With regulation and safeguards to the new crypto space always playing catch-up, all we can advise is to be very careful with anything crypto-related.</p><p></p><h3>8. Investing Tax Refunds in Cryptocurrency for Alleged Tax Circumvention in the Future</h3><p>\nThough similar to the last point, we thought this deserved its own spot on the list.  Some enterprising scammers are convincing unlucky victims that their tax refunds can be placed somewhere outside of the IRS’s reach, despite the IRS taxing cryptocurrency profits just like any other asset.</p><h3>9. Reduction in Tax Jeopardy if Paid by Debit Cards or Credit Cards</h3><p>\nBeing in ‘tax jeopardy’ or getting a ‘jeopardy assessment’ can be a stressful circumstance, not least because of the penalties involved. This is why these scams, where tax-related penalties or issues can be resolved with an immediate payment in the form of a ‘fee’, are so successful. Hold off on paying over the phone and only communicate with the IRS through their regular channels.\n</p><h3>10. Unemployment Fraud</h3><p>\nUnemployment fraud can take many forms, as con artists exploit the safety net that the government provides. However, with many losing their jobs during the pandemic period and filing for unemployment, one to look out for is the identity theft based scam. If you receive a Form 1099-G for unemployment compensation that you haven’t actually received, your identity could already have been stolen. If there is any indication that this has happened, go to law enforcement authorities directly for advice.\n</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MTZlMmE2MTItOTA2NS00YmYwLTgyN2ItMzVlOWU1NzkyZTMy_mje0ngzintmtzji5yi00njmzltlhymutowjkntvlzjc3mtjj_man-sitting-using-mobile-phone-truecaller-irs-scams-1.jpgresize7002c394ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,394&w=700&h=394\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /><h2>4 Tips to recognise a tax scam – THE IRS NEVER DOES THIS:</h2>Call to demand immediate payment using a specific payment method such as a prepaid debit card, iTunes gift card or wire transfer. The IRS does not use these methods for tax payments.Ask a taxpayer to make a payment to a person or organization other than the U.S. Treasury.Threaten to immediately bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have the taxpayer arrested for not paying.Demand taxes be paid without giving the taxpayer the opportunity to question or appeal the amount owed.\nSource (IRS)<h3>What else can I do?</h3><p>Download Truecaller for your cell phone – this is a free call blocking app that also has intelligent spam and scam protection to detect fake IRS calls, robocalls, telemarketers and other types of unwanted numbers.

    "html": "<h2>How we found CallHero</h2><p>We brought in Clayton LiaBraaten – our Senior Strategic Advisor, to share the story.</p><p>We are constantly conducting competitive and market intelligence as part of Truecaller’s improvement processes – we want to be better than we were yesterday.  This includes identifying product features and gaps that current solutions – including our own – are not addressing.</p><p>One of the most important things for us has been to find a solution on how we can protect Truecaller iPhone users with Caller ID and Spam blocking the same way we’ve been able to protect our Android users.  At the operating system level, iOS and Android are completely different. And we want to give everyone using Truecaller the best experience. So the quest began to identify an existing application which delivered a superior experience by:</p>Leveraging cloud communications services to overcome the aforementioned limitations in providing Caller ID and spam blocking.Deliver enhanced call management services like Call Screening and Smart Agents to provide users with added intelligence about who is calling, allowing our users to engage as desired and reclaim their phones.<p>After an exhaustive set of application testing, CallHero was identified as checking all of these boxes. All roads led to the founders Raf and Roy. And here we are now, on this exciting day!</p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>How does CallHero work?</h2><p>Your phone rings. It could be someone from your contact list, an unknown number, or maybe it’s a spam call. Instead of picking up, you can set up to have your personal assistant pick up the call. The assistant picks up the call, and asks who’s calling and why. You get a message with what they answer and  you decide if you wanna take the call or not. We recommend asking more questions to know more about what they want. That way you can filter out the robocallers and spam calls. Simple, sweet, and spam free. Just the way we at Truecaller like it. </p><p>Another great feature that CallHero brings to Truecaller users is the ability to add a second virtual number to your account. This can be used if you don’t want to give out your real number.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/M2I5MDBmOGItYzdkOC00YjYwLThkMjAtMWZiNzk1MWUzZjg3_80813eb4-d6cc-4f64-ba4a-3b644b9a33e5_callhero-1.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1350&w=2400&h=1350\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" /><h2>What comes next?</h2><p>We are excited to join our teams together, and continue to work on how to make Truecaller more user-friendly for both iPhone and Android users worldwide. In the coming months, the CallHero app will be phased out while we integrate many of their features, and brand-new ones, into Truecaller that will further the Truecaller experience and is in line with our vision of making tomorrow’s communication safer, smarter, and more efficient. Do you wanna be part of our journey?

What is unique to Truecaller is the spam detection algorithm. The app relies on the Truecaller Community to report spam numbers in real-time. With that, we’ve developed and improved the most current, accurate, and complete Caller ID and spam detection for every geography by automatically updating spam information, without you having to lift a finger. This means no need to wait until after the call to look up a number, your Truecaller app will be able to identify while it’s ringing. \n\nThe app also has a complete design refresh that results in much quicker sign up, and a more simple navigation through the app.</p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>Caller ID Emojis</h2>All numbers that have high report of spam activity will be identified with a 🚨warningAll numbers that are verified by Truecaller will be identified with a ✅If you’re receiving a call from a Truecaller Android user, those calls will be identified with a 📲For all calls that are not identified, you can always search for them on Truecaller.

    "html": "<h3>What is Caller ID?</h3><p>Caller ID is a feature that displays the caller’s number on the receiver’s phone before answering the call, along with the name, location, and more information about the caller if available. The Caller ID can even show if it’s likely someone you know is calling, or if it’s an important call.</p><h3>What makes Truecaller’s Caller ID different?</h3><p>Truecaller’s Caller ID has been very well received since it launched back in 2009, as it has been instrumental in screening known, unknown, or unwanted calls. Today, the Truecaller app helps you differentiate between normal, priority, spam and business calls with colour coded Caller IDs. Anyone with the app can deter or even block calls from scammers, spam callers or any suspicious numbers.</p><p>In 2021 alone, Truecaller’s Caller ID recognised and blocked 37.8 billion spam calls and 182 billion spam messages (and our community of users had quite a role to play in it!). Check out our year in calling stats here.</p><p>Now imagine the number of unsolicited calls and messages the app has blocked over all these years! That’s why we continue to improvise its functionality and are proud of our Caller ID that has been efficiently saving our community from falling into malicious traps, while staying responsible for keeping their data safe. Hence, we do not sell users’ names, phone numbers, or any other data with other entities.</p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h3>So, how does the Truecaller Caller ID work? </h3><p>The Truecaller Caller ID is intelligently designed to show users who is calling them, even if the caller is not in their address book. Now comes the big question – how? </p><h3>Phone directory</h3><p>In the interest of data minimisation, we don’t ask for unnecessary permissions or data from our users. Hence, only if the user gives permission, the phonebook data gets integrated with the app for a seamless calling and messaging experience. The name connected to the number (if not suggested by users already) is done based on sources like user-profiles and public partnerships.Additionally, users who register on our app can choose how they want to appear on the Caller ID by filling in their names. This is exactly why we keep encouraging our community to fill their Truecaller profile with correct information in the app to avoid getting false contact names against their numbers. </p><h3>Community sourcing</h3><p>We also determine the contact name through what the Truecaller community suggests through our app or website. For example: If an insurance spam number is saved or reported as ‘Insurance spam’ by the maximum number of our users, then that is what the caller ID will show to the receiver of the call from that particular number.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OWUzMTVmOWItYmJhYy00NGJlLWE3YjItMmM2ODliYzQxZjMw_055995b3-28d4-4ead-88f1-111550b9808c_blog-calleridsubarticleimg1.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1350&w=2400&h=1350\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" /><h3>Your data stays safe with us.</h3><p>Truecaller does not upload phonebooks to make them searchable or public from Google Play or Apple App Store downloads. We strictly follow the Google Play & Apple App Store guidelines, which prohibit any app from doing so.\n\nWe’re always adding or improving many calls and messaging features on the app. Stay tuned for more updates on Truecaller, and don’t forget to follow us on Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

    "html": "<p>SMS is convenient, easy and most importantly, trusted. But with the rise of chat applications (including Truecaller’s Group Chat), SMSes are struggling to stay relevant for mobile users.

That’s why Truecaller’s SMS has now become Chhota and smarter.</p><h2>What is Chhota SMS?</h2><p>In short, Chhota SMS helps you stay on top of important SMSes in the Truecaller App by condensing the information to show you exactly what you need at that moment.</p><p>It shows you only the essential information within the SMS while protecting you from spam and fraud messages.

    "html": "<h2>Truecaller Assistant: The Game Changer to Identify Unknown Callers </h2><p></p><p>Ever since we began, we’ve been trying to make communication easier with Caller ID, spam blocking and messaging. But with Truecaller Assistant, we’ve tried to take it a step even further. Here’s the idea: you’ll never be able to stop unwanted calls 100%. There are some calls, like from a deliverer, tradespeople or recruiters, that might be important to answer. Those calls, however, might be spam, might be a waste of time, might have been better as a text message instead. Wouldn’t it be great if there was something that could take the guesswork out of that?</p><p>Take Truecaller, sprinkle in a bit of AI and bam! Enter Truecaller Assistant. The AI-powered assistant is a call screening service that takes your call, asks the purpose of the call, and gives you the right information to decide whether or not it’s actually something you want or need to pick up.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YjNiZmI5YTgtMGE2MC00MDNiLWI2MTQtNzY2ZWUwNzNhMzQ0_57a5bc89-448f-44b4-8f93-624923a68fab_blog-assistantflow.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2584,1254&w=2584&h=1254\" alt=\"\" width=\"2584\" height=\"1254\" /><h2>So How Does It Work?</h2><p></p><p>When you get a call it rings on your phone as usual.</p><p>But if you decline or don't answer the call, it'll be forwarded to your digital Assistant. They'll answer and screen it for you using voice-to-text technology. When the caller responds to your Assistant, you'll be able to see who's calling and why on the screen.</p><p>The caller will hear the assistant asking ‘hi, the person you're calling is using a screening service, may I ask who it is?’ and the reason for the call. From here you can open up the chat window if you need more information. Then you can decide whether to accept or reject the call. </p><p>Forget accidentally ignoring important calls for deliveries and leaving them to the mercy of porch pirates. Forget missing important reminders from your doctor or your children’s school. And for those waiting for an important call back for a new job, you can be sure that you’ll know exactly which call that is, and won’t miss it amongst a sea of other calls.</p><h2>An Extra Layer of Spam Protection</h2><p></p><p>Our AI is able to filter the information given by the caller and is able to tell with more than 90% accuracy if the call is spam or not. With all this information, it is easier than ever to decide whether or not to pick up the call, or block!</p><p>The team at Truecaller has worked hard to bring this extra level of spam protection, on top of all the other features offered built up by our wonderful worldwide community.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MDMxZmNjZGEtNGY1MC00MDZhLTgxNjMtZTRhYzYwOTIwNTQz_526299d9-d6fa-496f-a691-60e8b1f57c34_blog-assistantselection.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2584,1254&w=2584&h=1254\" alt=\"\" width=\"2584\" height=\"1254\" /><h2>For Both Android and iOS</h2><p></p><p>Truecaller Assistant is unlike any other call screening services, especially for iPhone.,. Truecaller Assistant is available on a free, 14-day trial, after which subscribers can add Assistant as part of Truecaller Premium. The service will be launched in the United States and in English, with other markets and languages soon to follow. </p><p>Make sure to update your app and buy Premium to enjoy this feature if you want Truecaller Assistant to save you time and protect you from spam.</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram,Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.</p><p>If you’re based in India: Instagram India, and Twitter India.</p>"

Tushar Satyanath, Senior UX Designer at Truecaller, has been essential in the design process behind this big upgrade to Truecaller for iOS.</p>What were the main reasons for redesigning the iOS app?<p>We wanted to provide a simplified user experience with a freshly updated interface. We also wanted to bring valuable information up front for our end users. These changes will significantly impact the usability of our product. </p>What were the issues with the previous version?<p>Over the years, our app has constantly evolved based on metrics and user feedback. </p><p>We noticed that most users open the app to search for a number and see details of that number. Keeping that in mind, we chose to bring our search feature to the forefront of this redesign. Apart from the usability of its features, the previous interface did not leverage some of the UI components available in the latest software updates.</p>What was the process of redesigning the app? <p>We kicked off by underlying what the goal of the redesigned app should be. This allowed the entire team to envision the bigger picture. Our product team then got together to brainstorm and assess what would be the best solutions to achieve our end goal. Once we had a clear understanding of the direction we were heading, I started evaluating the potential solutions and began building the design system.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MmQ5ZDFkZjUtM2MyZi00YmVlLTg4ZmUtODFmNGZjMzU3NDQx_8bc5ce1e-6272-418b-a5af-1ba83d432a6a_blogimage328129.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />How do you know which design decisions are the right ones? How do you prove a thesis?<p>Knowing which design is the ‘right’ one is never easy. Empathising with our users is critical in our decision making process. It’s our responsibility to listen to their valuable feedback, analyse usability metrics, and adapt our assumptions accordingly. It’s also important to experiment sometimes and learn from the user interaction across markets. This enables us to validate the product vision, create insights and improve our design approach.</p>How was the design system built?<p>Once I had a sense of our product vision, I prepared some ideas for the redesign process. </p><p>I started by creating versions of our landing page through rough wireframes and prototypes. Meanwhile, I researched design trends, the latest iOS features and gathered visual design cues from various open source platforms. Next, I created high-fidelity screens with variants of UI elements and colour styles. After some deliberation and a few discarded ideas, our team fixed on a style that could extend beyond just the landing screen. It was at that moment I began constructing and creating specifications for all the individual components. </p>Why is a design system important?<p>Design systems are essential for bridging the gap between design and engineering. </p><p>It has significant benefits for teams to collaborate without re-inventing the wheel with every new project.</p><p>For example, if a text style change is required, one can simply update the core components in the design system and avoid rebuilding each screen from scratch.</p><p>Another advantage is that engineers can follow the same specifications and have cross-functional collaboration using predetermined guidelines. This avoids any inconsistencies in the long run. </p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OTNhZDlkMGYtYmIzZC00NWM2LWFjOGYtZWNlMTBiZWQyOWRh_20dc1c6b-6818-4b39-9522-76883c594c97_blogimage128129.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" />Which were the main tools that you used?<p>I start all my processes with notes and small sketches. But the primary tool that I used to create the design system was Figma. It is a powerful medium that enables cross-team collaboration. Other tools used for illustration and animation were the Adobe Creative Cloud apps. </p>What were the main challenges you faced during the process?<p>The reception of a complete design refresh is not always positive, so one has to be open to receiving critical feedback. Next, the creation of the design system is a very crucial part of the design workflow, though it can get time-consuming. It also needs to be planned in a way that every component can be scaled across various use cases. Another factor is  internal feedback. There was a unanimous decision to eliminate some of the features we had in the old app which had implications on the new concept.</p>What did you have in mind when redesigning the app? <p>Based on our research, we wanted to provide the most valuable features upfront and allow for feature discovery. As mentioned earlier, we wanted to cater to the primary use case of searching numbers with an all new landing screen. We also needed to add some hints and pointers to users to get the best out of Spam Protection. </p>What’s next for the iOS app?<p>Truecaller’s iOS app has a significant and loyal user base. This redesign is the first step into a series of initiatives that we are taking with our iOS app.</p><p>Even though there are technical limitations on iOS that might not allow us to provide the same experience as on Android, we are committed to supplying everything to maximise spam protection.</p><p>In the future, we will push the boundaries to provide a lot more sophisticated features which will make communication smarter, safer, and more efficient. </p><p>Do you want to know more about Tushar?

The most exciting part of our job is when there is a match between what the candidate is looking for and Truecaller. When it happens, that person becomes an employee. </p><p>Knowing that finding the right fit will mean changing someone’s professional career, and contributing to the company’s success and growth is what keeps us fueled to never give up in our roles\". </p><p></p><p>If you want to know more about how the team works,  </p><h2>Truecaller’s recruitment process </h2><p>\"When we find the matching talent, we hold the first chat to understand more about who the person is , what they’re looking for, as well as their background, values, and achievements. Afterward, in many cases, we hold a technical assessment to ensure the process is objective and equal for all candidates. After that, we have two interviews to ensure that the candidate understands the whole picture of the company. </p><p>Later, if everyone that has been a part of the process thinks that the candidate is a great fit, we go ahead with a Meet and Greet - an informal meeting with the extended team - and then, we offer the position! </p><p>Most importantly, at all the stages, we keep the candidate in the center, with great empathy: What does this person want? What are their expectations? What is essential for them?\"</p><p>Discover more about the process at the latest</p><h2>How we learn and improve </h2><p>\" 'Yes, I made a mistake'. We can say it freely, without fear, shame or excuses. We strive to work to high standards. But when failure knocks on the door, we have a conversation about it, as with any other topic. Discussing what support we need to  improve happens regularly in our stand-ups and our one-and-ones.</p><p>Or even in any interaction with our colleagues at any time!\"</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ODBiYjc2NzEtZDM5ZC00ZTFlLWE5NjUtN2RjMzE1ZWNlMDA2_fe665775-62aa-4288-9367-f4a96c2d3e18_christmaspartyta.jpg?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2316,2396&w=2316&h=2396\" alt=\"\" width=\"2316\" height=\"2396\" /><h2>How we have fun </h2><p>\"I believe that one of the main reasons that make us feel proud about what we do is how well we get along with each other.

    "html": "<h2>Introducing Truecaller Urgent Messages</h2><p>Sometimes you just really need to have your message read as soon as possible. With Urgent Messages on Truecaller for Android this will be possible. When someone sends you an urgent message, you’ll receive a notification that you can easily open – even on a locked screen. We used to have Truecaller flash – now we have Urgent Messages.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZmYwOGNlZjEtYWE1MS00MGRhLWJjYzYtYTUyNTQwNGIwYmUw_77cd2a7b-3c5b-4558-9f4a-49d1652e98d4_urgentmessages.gif?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,800,530&w=800&h=530\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" /><h2>3 Great Things You Can Do with Urgent Messages</h2><li>Answer with an animated emoji; nothing says “I got your message” as a flaming fire.</li><li>Send a quick voice message directly from the popup screen.</li><li>You can always close an urgent message. The message will be waiting for you in your Truecaller app.</li><h2>How to know it’s an Urgent Message</h2><p>It’s easy to know when you’re receiving an urgent message, just by the sound of it if you’re not looking at your screen. You can customise the ringtone for your urgent messages to suit your needs. If you peak at your screen and see a popup bubble, you’ll know – it’s an urgent message.</p><p>When it comes to the content of an urgent message, it’s basically up to you to decide what’s urgent. Some pro tips: what you’re having for dinner might not be as urgent as telling someone you need them to pick up the kids from school. Still not sure what identifies as an urgent message? Tweet us to ask, and we’ll help you decide.</p><h2>Long Press to Make Truecaller Messages Your Default Screen</h2><p>Imagine opening your Truecaller app to quickly send a group message of what you’ve been doing, and you have chosen to have the Calling interface open. No worries. Just long press the message button. That will make the messaging interface your default option. Text away. When you want to return to having the calling interface as default, you press the calls button and are back.  The next time you open the app, it will open with the new default setting. Welcome to the world of TrueMessenger.</p><p>This neat feature was actually suggested by Alan Mamedi, Truecaller’s CEO and co-founder. We work hard to have a culture that celebrates thinking outside the box, and we’re lucky to have a CEO who enjoys being a part of everyday work.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MTlmNzQ4MTYtNTAwMC00YTNjLWJhYzYtZjY2OWZkN2I2Mzkx_7b808ba4-e93c-4290-83e7-0d79eac13582_truecallerlongpress.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,2400,1504&w=2400&h=1504\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1504\" /><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><h2>Smart SMS becomes smarter – with your help</h2><p>Smart SMS is one of our favorite features, and yours as well. Basically Smart SMS helps you categorise what is an important message, and what should be moved to the Spam inbox. We’ve worked hard to make the experience better, and being able to organise what is spam or not. Even if it’s from the same sender. Confusing? No worries, we’re here to help explain it.</p><p>The improved Smart SMS will now look at different levels of incoming messages in a region, to determine whether it should be moved to spam or to the important inbox – depending on the content in the messages. There is no magic in here, this is dependant on how you rate the message. So if you’re being asked whether it’s spam or important – be sure to answer. That way you’re training the system to help you have an even better experience – locally on your phone.</p><p>Be a part of improving the Smart SMS experience for millions of people!</p><h3>Share your Smart Card </h3><p>Another great thing with Smart SMS is that you get notified about important updates – like your next flight, a transaction, or a bill. We’ve been asked to be able to share that information the same easy way that you see it, and now that’s possible! When you open your Smart Card there’s an option to share, and that entire Smart Card gets shared according to your choice. This will be shared as an image, just as easily read as it is for you, to anyone. Even if they’re not on Truecaller.</p><h2>Edit Sent Chat Messages</h2><p>We all make mistakes when typing in a hurry. If you made mistakes or said something that you did not mean to say, the edit feature will be a boon. With the new update, you can edit/ make changes to the chat message even after the receiver has viewed it. If you do edit a message, the words ‘Chat (edited)’ will be visible. You can edit chat messages at any time after sending and it’s important to note that editing is only available for Truecaller Chat, not SMS.</p><p>We hope you found some new, smart ways to customise your Truecaller Messaging experience. Also, be sure to keep your Truecaller app updated! With a community of over 300 million people using Truecaller every month, Truecaller offers a great communication experience.</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.\nIf you’re based in India: Instagram India, and Twitter India. \nBased in Indonesia: Instagram Indonesia, TikTok Indonesia. </p><p>Yes, we are available to you everywhere!</p>"

    "html": "<h2>What made us take a stand against women’s harassment?</h2><p>With women being a significant part of Truecaller’s user base, we realised how harassment through phones had become a huge cause of concern for women worldwide over the years. Be it texts, phone calls or emails, most women experience harassment in some way or the other quite frequently. Through our past surveys, we found that 1 out of 5 women in India receives sexual and inappropriate calls or SMSes. This shows the extent of normalisation of harassment in the country. We need to create an environment that allows women to feel safe on roads, at their homes, on digital platforms, and everywhere else.\n\nAs a brand that focuses on making tomorrow’s communication smarter, safer, and more efficient, we felt it’s our responsibility to take an immediate stance and curb this alarming nuisance. This led us to launch the #ItsnotOK campaign in 2017, which was designed to raise awareness, spread the message and encourage women to speak up against harassment in digital and the real world. Since the initiation of the initiative, women around the world started sharing their experiences and it has been an eye opener.\n</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZTdlOGE5YmEtOTU2Yi00YzAxLThiZGMtNDM3NTgzNDZiNTFk_mzzhmzu2nwetn2q5ys00otywlwfmmtytmjrjmduxmtzlndzi_wd-blog.jpegresize7002c527ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,527&w=700&h=527\" alt=\"#ItsNotOK for Women to be Harassed - Truecaller\" width=\"700\" height=\"527\" /><p>\nThis further strengthened our purpose to spread the message far and wide. After five years into the fight of successfully raising awareness and becoming more conscious about the act of harassment, further research also showed that 86% of the women in India who receive sexual harassment calls and texts block the number, while only 12% report it to the authorities. So this year, we’re encouraging women to take another leap because only blocking harassers doesn’t seem to be the permanent fix. It’s become crucial to report the incidences to the respective authorities to battle harassment out of our lives. Precisely what our campaign in 2022 will be about – encouraging women not just to block, but empowering them to #CallItOut and report harassment cases. </p><h2>2022 looks promising with impactful collaborations to #CallItOut</h2><p>For the #CallItOut campaign to be impactful, we have joined hands with various entities who we believe will help us fight the cause and spread the word to every corner of the country.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MTQ0NjFjMmQtMTVhYS00YmU0LWE3ZjktOGQ0MjY4MzIzNDc3_ytfkzmjkndatmmq0ns00zmuwltg2ngqtmtcwodczzji5ode2_truecaller-slates-recovered-22-1.jpgresize7002c394ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,394&w=700&h=394\" alt=\"It's time to start reporting harassment and #CallItOut\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" /><h3>Joining hands with CyberPeace Foundation</h3><p>We’ve partnered with CyberPeace Foundation to launch the TrueCyberSafe program and encourage digital users to understand their online presence better, helping them not only to develop the requisite skills for enjoying digital technology but also by aiding them in nurturing the faculties of critical thinking and empathy. To do so, we’re aiming to run safety training programs in Delhi, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, North-Eastern Region (Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland) and Odisha and train 16 lakh people over 6 months to increase awareness about online safety along with ways to avoid frauds, scams and spams. The training will be imparted in local languages as well to ensure accessibility and increase reach. The program will aim to empower the participants to:</p>Be aware of their Digital Rights and ResponsibilitiesBe able to recognise and manage Online RisksBecome conscious and responsible about following healthy online practices <h3>Collaboration with Network 18</h3><p>We’ve also joined hands with India’s largest news network – Network 18, to spread the word to every corner of the country with impactful on-ground events, print communication and numerous discussions on television and on social media involving experts such as the trauma experts, women’s rights activists, spokespersons from the Delhi Police, and more to bring forth a collective of knowledge and awareness around the issue of online harassment.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/MWZiOGQzNzYtNTdjMy00NTU5LTk4NTgtMjIyZmFkMGYwNDUw_nzzlyziwmzgtmjkzzc00yzuylthlotatnjk5zdqyodcxywmw_wd-image.jpegresize7002c700ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,700&w=700&h=700\" alt=\"It's time to take a stand against women's harassment #CallItOut\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" /><h3>Making Verified Helpline Numbers available in the app</h3><p>In times of distress, we want people to have the right source of help. This is  why we’ve made the verified emergency numbers of the women’s helpline number (181) and emergency number (112) available on the Home Screen of the Truecaller app, so that help can be just one tap away.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZTliM2NjZDgtMDI5OC00YjgzLTkxYWYtMjI0ZWUyMzg4ZmQ5_nzdjntk3zwytnjzkoc00odcwlthiyzytmtixzwfhyjcxowjh_screens-of-helpline-number.jpegresize7002c875ampssl1?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,700,875&w=700&h=875\" alt=\"Women Helpline number to stay away from harassment.\" width=\"700\" height=\"875\" /><p>The fight against women’s harassment is an uphill task but we are in it for the long haul. It is imperative that we create a safe environment for women to grow and prosper. From policymakers who make laws to protect women to police officers who enforce those laws,  to technology companies who find digital solutions to these problems, there is a need for everyone to come together to fight this. We need to channel information, leverage technology, create easy ways to report crimes and take action in a speedy manner. Only then can we create an ecosystem where women feel safe, confident and are empowered. \n\nJoin us as we take another step towards women safety in the country.

So if you see your screen turn red, don’t pick up. </p><button style=\"text-align: Center;\">Download Truecaller</button><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ODA4Y2I0ZWUtYjBiMi00ZjQxLTlhNDQtMDYwOGVjZjk1MDcy_148c8897-66e5-4559-b702-34807b450c70_blog-colorsofcallerid-3.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"A green screen with a green Caller ID\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><h2>Green Means a Business Verified by Truecaller</h2><p>If the screen turns green, it means that a business verified by Truecaller is calling you. This feature, known as Truecaller for Business, ensures that the caller is actually calling from the company they claim to represent. It makes it easy to identify legitimate business calls and helps businesses connect with their customers. However, it's worth noting that sometimes a verified business number might be marked as spam by some people. This is usually because they find the call not useful, but it's not recommended by us. </p><p>As an example, if you need new home insurance and receive a call from a verified insurance business, it's a good call. But someone who doesn't need new insurance might mark it as spam, which could be confusing without the verified business mark.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/ZDYyYTQ4ODEtYzUxOC00Y2VmLWFmOTUtODQ0MGEwNzdkZDUz_131557d6-d077-48c6-a18c-c6796584b806_blog-colorsofcallerid-4.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,675&w=1200&h=675\" alt=\"A purple screen with a purple Caller ID\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><h2>Purple is a Time-sensitive Business Call Verified by Truecaller </h2><p>Receiving unknown calls can be frustrating, especially when you're waiting for something important, like your food delivery. But with Truecaller's Full-Screen Caller ID, you can relax when you see the screen turn purple. This means that it's a verified business calling you for a time-sensitive matter - such as your food delivery. It could also be the delivery of your new TV, flowers from a friend, or even your kids' new swing. You can trust the purple screen, similar to the green Caller ID, as a way to know that it's a time-sensitive matter from a verified business.</p><p>You are now all set for a carefree calling experience. All you need to do is to check your screen before picking up the call. Let the colors of the rainbow guide you.</p><p>Also, update your Truecaller app! With a community of over 330 million people using Truecaller every month, Truecaller offers a great communication experience.</p><p>To stay tuned for more updates, visit Truecaller’s Youtube Channel, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter.</p><p>If you’re based in India follow us on Instagram India, and Twitter India as well.</p><p></p>"

    "html": "<p>The pandemic significantly impacted eCommerce trends across the world. In 2021, mobile shopping from Shopify merchants captured 71% of online sales via mobile. Globally, Shopify store owners made an astonishing $6.3 billion USD between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which was a 23% increase from 2020.</p><p>As people’s appetite for online shopping continues to increase, their expectations are also on the rise. They want a safer, quicker, and more seamless checkout process. Even a small hiccup like a delayed OTP or a long registration form can result in drop-offs.</p><p>It’s reported that eCommerce stores lose 8 billion in sales revenue each year because of cart abandonment. Statista did a survey on ‘what shoppers do after abandoning their cart in the UK’ and found that 26% of shoppers purchase the items from other online retailers, whereas 8% of shoppers go to a physical store to make the purchase. </p><h3>Moral of the story? </h3><p>User drop-offs or cart abandonment can cost you serious business opportunities.  </p><h2>Top reasons for cart abandonment</h2><p>A seamless checkout experience is integral to your eCommerce store.  You get it right and you get a returning customer. You get it wrong and your customers will leave with a bad taste in their mouth, which is not ideal for your brand’s reputation.</p><p>Baymard Institute recently did a quantitative study to understand the reasons for cart abandonment. They found that 58.6% of US online shoppers had abandoned at least one cart in the last 3 months. 24% of these people didn’t want to create an account, and 17% felt the checkout process was too long.</p><p>A lot of shoppers find it frustrating to manually enter their personal details for a single purchase—which is why almost a quarter of cart abandonment happens because the site asks them to create an account.</p><img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/YWRlOTdkYTMtODNkNy00NDE5LWI5NWItYzk1Y2Q0ZjE4MmEy_c4506101-9e86-4a6e-83fd-6a4994fb33c7_blog-shopify-2.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1200,616&w=1200&h=616\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"616\" /><p>For Shopify merchants too, it is not that easy to recover abandoned carts and ask shoppers to complete their checkout.  Yes, automated reminder emails are sent to shoppers, but in certain circumstances, they don’t get triggered. </p><p>Therefore, the best solution is to reduce the frequency of cart abandonment itself. This can be done by accelerating the user verification and checkout process and giving quick gratification to shoppers.</p><h2>How Truecaller is solving the cart abandonment problem for Shopify stores </h2><p>Shopify merchants can now use Truecaller’s Number Verification app for their stores. The app will enable a one-tap, OTP-free user verification for shoppers who already have their verified profiles (mobile number-based) on Truecaller app. They can skip the hassle of a multi-step verification process and get their details auto-filled with just one tap. </p><p>Here’s a quick video for you. </p><p>With our number verification solution, Shopify merchants can:</p>Reduce user drop-offs by instantly verifying and auto-filling user details, and sparing shoppers from all the boring stuff.Save OTP costs by making the entire process from verification to checkout OTP-free.Materialise a simple, zero-effort flow and do away with typos, as users don’t require typing anything.Ensure quick checkout with fewer steps/ screens, thereby keeping shoppers enthusiastic about their purchase.  <img src=\"http://localhost:3000/images/tc-main/OGRkM2MxM2ItMmEyNC00ODQ2LTgyMDItODJmODI0ZDhmMDgw_ef712619-c872-4ac9-bb65-7ce3b964c2e6_blog-shopify-3.png?auto=compress,format&rect=0,0,1196,475&w=1196&h=475\" alt=\"\" width=\"1196\" height=\"475\" /><p>Our solution is fueled by our ever-expanding user base of Truecaller, which now stands at 356+ million.
